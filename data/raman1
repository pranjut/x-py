Great effort.
session was good.
session was very interactive.
Communication skills and Pace of discussion were too good.
The presentation was good overall but a few places, you were unable to handle the questions properly.
Good session raman :)
nice presentation!
Let me tell you, Raman, you are a nice presenter.
So, I'll only explain <5 points, When you asked for suggestions and questions, if someone is giving suggestions, you need to repeat that suggestion, so that it becomes a part of your recording and the viewers can understand what was the suggestion, and what could be better when the presenter was showing a weak point... 
I just felt that you just listened to Bhavya's point and ignored it compeletely...
No one other than you uderstood what he said..
In conclusion it was nice... but not better than your previous one ;)
Try to be a more expressive not just to yourself but to the audience as well :)
Good Session. Some Examples could have been better.
Good session. Just one tip, take a few seconds to process the question from the audience. Will help formulate the answer better.

Nice Presentation!
It's always great to see things working with a running demo.
Presentation was good but it would be better if we could see a working demo.
1. Presenter little bit nervous. 2. Good point is, I doesn't have interest in ML, but still, this session makes interest.
Very new thing for me. very informative session
Session was really good.
It was a good sesion.
It was a nice session. It would be good if the session can be made a bit more interesting so that people do not get bored. It might be just because the session was bit theoretical.
Good introductory session for dimension reduction. The demo didn't work. You have to be more comfortable and confident while giving session. Good examples.
