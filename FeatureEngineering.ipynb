    "IPython has a set of predefined ‘magic functions’ that you can call with a command line style syntax. There are two kinds of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented. Line magics are prefixed with the % character and work much like OS command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes. Lines magics can return results and can be used in the right hand side of an assignment. Cell magics are prefixed with a double %%, and they are functions that get as an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a separate argument.\n",

      " and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called\n",
      "  and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed\n",
      "  and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba\n",
      "  and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs\n",
      "  and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child\n",
      "and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept\n",
      "  and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar\n",
      "fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is\n",
      "  arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation\n",
      "  and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink\n",
      "  and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer\n",
      "  and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt\n",
      "  and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest  now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my son s son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned\n",
      "  and abraham said i will swear\n",
      "  and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelech s servants had violently taken away\n",
      "  and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day\n",
      "  and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant\n",
      "  and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves\n",
      "  and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves\n",
      "  and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well\n",
      "  wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them\n",
      "  thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines\n",
      "  and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god\n",
      " and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days\n",
      " and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am\n",
      " and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of\n",
      " and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him\n",
      " then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off\n",
      " and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you\n",
      " and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together\n",
      " and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son\n",
      "and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering\n",
      " and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together\n",
      " and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood\n",
      "  and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i\n",
      " and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me\n",
      "  and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son\n",
      "  and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time   and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son   that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies   and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice\n",
      "  so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba\n",
      "  and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor   huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram   and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel\n",

      "and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight\n",
      "and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead\n",
      "and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth\n",
      "and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you\n",

      "  and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them\n",
      "  and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved\n",
      "  and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son   and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck   and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob\n",
      "  and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son\n",
      "  and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me\n",
      "  and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son\n",
      "and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me\n",
      "  and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not\n",
      "  and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacob s voice but the hands are the hands of esau\n",
      " and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esau s hands so he blessed him\n",
      "  and he said art thou my very son esau\n",
      "and he said i am\n",
      "  and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my son s venison that my soul may bless thee\n",
      "and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank\n",
      "  and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son\n",
      "  and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed   therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine   let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mother s sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee\n",
      "  and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting\n",
      "  and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his son s venison that thy soul may bless me\n",

      "and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau\n",
      "  and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who\n",
      "where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him\n",
      "yea and he shall be blessed\n",
      " and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father\n",
      "  and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing\n",
      "  and he said is not he rightly named jacob\n",
      "for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing\n",

      "  now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran   and tarry with him a few days until thy brother s fury turn away  until thy brother s anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day\n",
      "  and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me\n",
      " and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan\n",

      "  and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran\n",
      "  and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep\n",
      " and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it\n",
      "  and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed   and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed\n",
      "  and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of\n",
      "  and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not\n",
      "  and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place\n",
      "this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven\n",
      "  and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it\n",

      " then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east\n",
      " and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the well s mouth\n",
      " and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the well s mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the well s mouth in his place\n",

      "wherefore then hast thou beguiled me\n",
      "  and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn\n",
      "  fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years\n",

      "  and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing\n",
      " and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die\n",
      " and jacob s anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in god s stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb\n",
      " and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her\n",

      "  and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it\n",
      "  and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me\n",
      "  for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also\n",
      "  and he said what shall i give thee\n",
      "and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock\n",
      "  i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire\n",

      "  and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons\n",
      "  and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of laban s flocks\n",
      "  and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods\n",
      "  and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink\n",
      "  and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted\n",
      "  and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto laban s cattle\n",
      "  and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods\n",
      "  but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were laban s and the stronger jacob s\n",
      "  and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses\n",
      " and he heard the words of laban s sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our father s and of that which was our father s hath he gotten all this glory\n",
      " and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before\n",
      " and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee\n",
      " and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock  and said unto them i see your father s countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me\n",
      " and ye know that with all my power i have served your father\n",
      " and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me\n",
      " if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked\n",
      " thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me\n",
      "  and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled\n",
      "  and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i\n",
      " and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee\n",
      "  i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred\n",
      "  and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father s house\n",
      "  are we not counted of him strangers\n",
      "for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money\n",
      "  for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our children s now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do\n",

      "  then laban overtook jacob\n",
      "now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead\n",
      "  and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword\n",
      "  wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp\n",
      "  and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters\n",
      "thou hast now done foolishly in so doing\n",
      "  it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad\n",
      "  and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy father s house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods\n",
      "  and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me\n",
      "  with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee\n",
      "for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them\n",
      "  and laban went into jacob s tent and into leah s tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not\n",
      "then went he out of leah s tent and entered into rachel s tent\n",
      " now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camel s furniture and sat upon them\n",

      "  and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me\n",
      "and he searched but found not the images\n",
      "  and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass\n",
      "what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me\n",
      "  whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff\n",
      "set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both\n",
      "  this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten\n",
      "  that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night\n",
      "  thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes\n",
      "  thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times\n",

      " and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee   i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands\n",
      "  deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children\n",
      " and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude\n",
      "  and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother   two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams   thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals\n",
      "  and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove\n",
      "  and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou\n",
      "and whither goest thou\n",
      "and whose are these before thee\n",
      "  then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacob s it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us\n",
      "  and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him\n",
      "  and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us\n",
      "for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me\n",
      "  so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company\n",
      "  and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok\n",
      " and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had\n",
      "  and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day\n",
      "  and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob s thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him\n",
      "  and he said let me go for the day breaketh\n",
      "and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me\n",
      "  and he said unto him what is thy name\n",

      "  and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh\n",
      "  therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacob s thigh in the sinew that shrank\n",
      " and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men\n",

      " and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee\n",
      "and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant\n",
      " then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves\n",
      " and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves\n",
      " and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met\n",
      "and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord\n",
      " and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself\n",
      "  and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me\n",
      "  take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough\n",
      "and he urged him and he took it\n",
      " and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee\n",
      "  and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die\n",
      "  let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir\n",
      "  and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me\n",
      "and he said what needeth it\n",

      "ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife\n",
      " and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister  and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us  but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised  then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people\n",

      "  behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt   and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land   and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous\n",
      "  and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass\n",
      "  now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt\n",

      "  and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating\n",
      "  and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning\n",
      "  notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses was wroth with them\n",
      "  and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted\n",
      "  and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses\n",

      "and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel\n",
      " and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not\n",
      " then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim\n",
      " and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand\n",
      "  so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill\n",
      "  and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed\n",
      " but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun\n",
      "  and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword\n",
      "  and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven\n",
      "  and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi   for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation\n",
      " when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt  then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back  and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land  and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh  and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god  and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her\n",

      " and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god\n",
      "  and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening\n",
      "  and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people\n",
      "why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even\n",
      "  and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god   when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws\n",
      "  and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good\n",

      "  and the children of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor\n",
      " and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying   aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah\n",
      "  take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor   and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there\n",

      " and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way\n",
      " and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness\n",
      "for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread\n",
      " and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died\n",

      " and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived\n",
      "  and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth\n",
      "  and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising\n",
      " from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared\n",
      "  from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites\n",

      "  and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water\n",
      "  then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it   the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves\n",
      "and from the wilderness they went to mattanah   and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth   and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon\n",
      "  and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying   let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the king s high way until we be past thy borders\n",
      " and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel\n",
      "  and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong\n",
      "  and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof\n",
      "  for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon\n",
      "  wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared   for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon\n",

      " and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed\n",
      "  and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you\n",
      "  and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us\n",
      "  and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they\n",
      "  and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me   for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people\n",
      "  and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more\n",
      "  now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more\n",
      "  and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do\n",
      "  and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab\n",
      "  and god s anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him\n",
      "now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him\n",
      " and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way\n",
      "  but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side\n",
      "  and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaam s foot against the wall and he smote her again\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left\n",
      "  and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaam s anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff\n",
      "  and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times\n",
      "  and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee\n",

      "  then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times\n",
      "behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me   and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive\n",
      " and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak\n",
      "so balaam went with the princes of balak\n",

      " and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar\n",
      " and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder\n",
      " and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus\n",
      " and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him\n",

      " that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims  a people great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead  as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day and the avims which dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead \n",

      " this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee\n",
      " and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying  let me pass through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left\n",
      " thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my feet  as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the moabites which dwell in ar did unto me  until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us\n",

      " and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land\n",
      " then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at jahaz\n",

      " for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over\n",
      " and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people\n",
      "and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them  about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho\n",
      " on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life\n",
      " and the lord spake unto joshua saying  command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan\n",
      " joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of jordan\n",
      " and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before\n",
      " and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho\n",
      " and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal\n",
      " and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones\n",
      " then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land\n",
      "for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over  that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever\n",
      "and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel\n",
      "at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time\n",
      "and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins\n",
      "and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt\n",
      "now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised\n",
      "for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey\n",
      "and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way\n",
      "and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole\n",
      "and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you\n",
      "wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day\n",
      " and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho\n",
      " and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day\n",
      "and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year\n",
      " and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries\n",
      " and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come\n",
      "and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant\n",
      " and the captain of the lord s host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy\n",
      "and joshua did so\n",
      "now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in\n",
      "and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour\n",
      "and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once\n",
      "thus shalt thou do six days\n",
      "and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets\n",
      "and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram s horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him\n",
      "and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord\n",
      "and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord\n",
      "and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them\n",
      "and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets\n",
      " and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout\n",
      " so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp\n",
      "and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord\n",
      " and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets\n",
      " and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days\n",
      " and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven times\n",
      " and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city\n",
      " and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent\n",
      " and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it\n",
      " but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord\n",
      " so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city\n",
      " and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword\n",
      " but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot s house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her\n",
      "and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel\n",
      " and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord\n",
      " and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her father s household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho\n",
      " and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it\n",
      " so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the country\n",
      "but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel\n",
      "and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven on the east of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country\n",
      "and the men went up and viewed ai\n",
      "and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but few\n",
      "so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai\n",
      "and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water\n",
      "and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads\n",
      "and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us\n",
      "would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side jordan\n",
      "o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies\n",
      "for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name\n",
      " and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face\n",
      " israel hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff\n",
      "therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you\n",
      " up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you\n",
      " in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man\n",
      " and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel\n",
      " so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken  and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken  and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken\n",
      " and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me\n",
      " and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done  when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it\n",
      " so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it\n",
      "and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord\n",
      " and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of achor\n",
      " and joshua said why hast thou troubled us\n",
      "the lord shall trouble thee this day\n",
      "and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones\n",
      " and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day\n",
      "so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger\n",
      "wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day\n",
      "and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it\n",
      "so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night\n",
      "and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them\n",
      "then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand\n",
      "and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do\n",
      "see i have commanded you\n",
      "joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people\n",
      " and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai\n",
      " and all the people even the people of war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai\n",
      "and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city\n",
      " and when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley\n",
      " and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city\n",
      " and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness\n",
      " and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from the city\n",
      " and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel\n",
      " and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand\n",
      "and joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city\n",
      " and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fire\n",
      " and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers\n",
      " and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of ai\n",
      " and the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape\n",
      "and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua\n",
      " and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword\n",
      " and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai\n",
      " for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai\n",
      " only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua\n",
      " and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a desolation unto this day\n",
      " and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day\n",
      " then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal  as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace offerings\n",
      " and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel\n",
      " and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel\n",
      "and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law\n",
      " there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them\n",
      "and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord\n",
      "and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai they did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy\n",
      "and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us\n",
      "and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you\n",
      "and they said unto joshua we are thy servants\n",
      "and joshua said unto them who are ye\n",
      "and from whence come ye\n",
      "and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt  and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth\n",
      " wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us\n",
      "this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy  and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey\n",
      " and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord\n",
      " and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them\n",
      " and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them\n",
      " and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day\n",
      "now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim\n",
      " and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel\n",
      "and all the congregation murmured against the princes\n",
      " but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them\n",
      " this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them\n",
      " and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them\n",
      " and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us\n",
      "now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god\n",
      " and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing\n",
      " and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do\n",
      " and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not\n",
      " and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose\n",
      " now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them  that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty\n",
      " wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying  come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel\n",
      " therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it\n",
      " and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us\n",
      " so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour\n",
      " and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee\n",
      " joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night\n",
      "  and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah\n",
      "  and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword\n",
      " then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon\n",
      "  and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies\n",
      "is not this written in the book of jasher\n",
      "so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day\n",
      "  and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel\n",
      "  and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal\n",
      "  but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah\n",
      "  and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah\n",
      "  and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them   and stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand\n",
      "  and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities\n",
      "  and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel\n",
      "  then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave\n",
      " and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon\n",
      "  and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings\n",
      "and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them\n",
      "  and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight\n",
      "  and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening\n",

      "then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them\n",
      " when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber\n",
      " and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth\n",
      " and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto seirath\n",
      " and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him from the mount and he before them\n",
      " and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand\n",
      "and they went down after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not a man to pass over\n",
      " and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man\n",
      " so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel\n",
      "and the land had rest fourscore years\n",
      " and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel\n",

      "and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles\n",
      "and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel\n",

      "and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment\n",
      "and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun\n",

      "and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him\n",
      " again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is there any man here\n",
      "that thou shalt say no\n",
      " then jael heber s wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary\n",

      "then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley\n",
      "and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me\n",
      "now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead\n",
      "and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand\n",
      "and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go\n",
      "so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink\n",
      "and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water\n",
      "and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place\n",
      "so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley\n",
      "and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand\n",
      " but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host  and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host\n",
      "then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host\n",
      "and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude\n",
      " and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along\n",
      " and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host\n",
      " and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian\n",
      " and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every man s hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers\n",
      " and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do\n",
      " when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon\n",
      " so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands\n",
      " and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon\n",
      " and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled\n",
      " and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every man s sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath\n",
      "and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after the midianites\n",
      " and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan\n",
      "then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan\n",
      " and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan\n",
      "and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the midianites\n",
      "and they did chide with him sharply\n",
      "and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you\n",
      "is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer\n",
      "god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you\n",
      "then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that\n",
      "and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them\n",
      "and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian\n",
      "and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army\n",
      "and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers\n",
      "and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him\n",
      "and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower\n",
      " now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword\n",
      " and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure\n",
      "and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host\n",
      " and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up  and caught a young man of the men of succoth and enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men\n",
      " and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary\n",
      " and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth\n",
      " and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city\n",
      " then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor\n",
      "and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king\n",
      " and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you\n",
      " and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them\n",
      "but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth\n",
      " then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength\n",
      "and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks\n",
      " then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy son s son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian\n",
      "and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you\n",
      " and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey\n",
      "for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites \n",
      " and they answered we will willingly give them\n",
      "and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey\n",
      " and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks\n",
      " and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house\n",
      " thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more\n",
      "and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon\n",
      " and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house\n",
      " and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives\n",
      " and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called abimelech\n",
      " and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites\n",
      " and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and made baalberith their god\n",
      "and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side  neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel\n",
      "and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother s brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mother s father saying speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you\n",
      "remember also that i am your bone and your flesh\n",
      "and his mother s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother\n",
      "and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him\n",
      "and he went unto his father s house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself\n",
      "and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem\n",
      "and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you\n",
      "the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us\n",
      "but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees\n",
      " and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us\n",
      " but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees\n",
      "then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us\n",
      " and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees\n",
      " then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us\n",
      " and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon\n",
      " now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands  for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian  and ye are risen up against my father s house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother   if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you  but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech\n",
      " and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother\n",
      " when abimelech had reigned three years over israel then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech  that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren\n",
      " and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told abimelech\n",
      " and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him\n",
      " and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech\n",
      " and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should serve him\n",
      "is not he the son of jerubbaal\n",
      "and zebul his officer\n",
      "serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for why should we serve him\n",
      " and would to god this people were under my hand\n",
      "then would i remove abimelech\n",
      "and he said to abimelech increase thine army and come out\n",
      " and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed his anger was kindled\n",
      " and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold they fortify the city against thee\n",
      " now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field  and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion\n",
      "and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies\n",
      " and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from lying in wait\n",
      " and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there come people down from the top of the mountains\n",
      "and zebul said unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men\n",
      " and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim\n",
      " then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him\n",
      "is not this the people that thou hast despised\n",
      "go out i pray now and fight with them\n",
      " and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech\n",
      " and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate\n",
      " and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in shechem\n",
      " and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told abimelech\n",
      " and he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote them\n",
      " and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them\n",
      "and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt\n",
      " and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith\n",
      " and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together\n",
      " and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do make haste and do as i have done\n",
      " and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also about a thousand men and women\n",
      " then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it\n",
      " but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the tower\n",
      " and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire\n",
      " and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelech s head and all to brake his skull\n",
      " then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a women slew him\n",
      "and his young man thrust him through and he died\n",
      " and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his place\n",
      "thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren  and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal\n",
      " and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim\n",
      " and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in shamir\n",
      " and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty and two years\n",
      " and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which are in the land of gilead\n",
      " and jair died and was buried in camon\n",
      " and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and served not him\n",
      " and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon\n",
      " and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead\n",
      " moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel was sore distressed\n",
      "  and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also served baalim\n",
      "  and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines\n",
      " the zidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and i delivered you out of their hand\n",
      "  yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more\n",
      "  go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation\n",
      "  and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we pray thee this day\n",
      "  and they put away the strange gods from among them and served the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel\n",
      "  then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped in gilead\n",
      "and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpeh\n",
      "  and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon\n",
      "he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead\n",
      " now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah\n",
      " and gilead s wife bare him sons and his wife s sons grew up and they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our father s house for thou art the son of a strange woman\n",
      " then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him\n",
      " and it came to pass in process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel\n",
      " and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob  and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of ammon\n",
      " and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me and expel me out of my father s house\n",
      "and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress\n",
      " and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead\n",
      " and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall i be your head\n",
      "  and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words\n",
      "  then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh\n",
      " and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land\n",
      "  and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably\n",
      "  and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon   and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon   but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh   then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto\n",
      "and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abode in kadesh\n",
      "  then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab\n",
      "  and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my place\n",
      "  but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel\n",
      "  and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country\n",
      "  and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan\n",
      " so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it\n",
      "  wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess\n",
      "so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess\n",
      "  and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab\n",
      "did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them   while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of arnon three hundred years\n",
      "why therefore did ye not recover them within that time\n",
      "  wherefore i have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon\n",
      "  howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him\n",
      "  then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon\n",
      "  and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands   then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lord s and i will offer it up for a burnt offering\n",
      "  so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hands\n",
      "  and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter\n",
      "thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel\n",
      " and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter\n",
      "  and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter\n",
      "thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back\n",
      "  and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of ammon\n",
      "  and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows\n",
      "  and he said go\n",
      "and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains\n",
      "  and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man\n",
      "and it was a custom in israel   that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year\n",
      "and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee\n",
      "we will burn thine house upon thee with fire\n",
      "and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not out of their hands\n",
      "and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me\n",
      "then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites\n",
      "and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite\n",
      "if he said nay then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right\n",

      " and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years\n",
      " and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not\n",

      " now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing  for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines\n",
      " then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name  but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death\n",
      " then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born\n",
      " and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her\n",
      "  and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day\n",
      "  and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman\n",
      "and he said i am\n",
      " and manoah said now let thy words come to pass\n",
      "how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her beware\n",
      "  she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe\n",
      "  and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the lord\n",
      "for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord\n",
      "  and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour\n",
      "  and the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my name seeing it is secret\n",
      "  so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on\n",
      "  for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar\n",
      "and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground\n",
      "  but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife\n",
      "then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord\n",
      "  and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god\n",
      " but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as at this time have told us such things as these\n",
      "  and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him\n",
      "  and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol\n",
      " and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines\n",
      " and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now therefore get her for me to wife\n",
      " then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines\n",
      "and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well\n",
      " but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel\n",
      " then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared against him\n",
      " and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done\n",
      " and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased samson well\n",
      " and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion\n",
      " and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion\n",
      "  so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do\n",
      "  and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him\n",
      " and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments   but if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments\n",
      "and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it\n",
      "  and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness\n",
      "and they could not in three days expound the riddle\n",
      "  and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samson s wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy father s house with fire have ye called us to take that we have\n",
      "is it not so\n",
      "  and samson s wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me\n",
      "and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee\n",
      "  and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people\n",
      "  and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey\n",
      "and what is stronger than a lion\n",
      "and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle\n",
      "  and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle\n",
      "and his anger was kindled and he went up to his father s house\n",
      "  but samson s wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend\n",
      " but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber\n",
      "but her father would not suffer him to go in\n",
      " and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she\n",
      "take her i pray thee instead of her\n",
      " and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless than the philistines though i do them a displeasure\n",
      " and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails\n",
      " and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives\n",
      " then the philistines said who hath done this\n",
      "and they answered samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion\n",
      "and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire\n",
      " and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i be avenged of you and after that i will cease\n",
      " and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam\n",
      " then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread themselves in lehi\n",
      "  and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us\n",
      "and they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us\n",
      "  then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us\n",
      "what is this that thou hast done unto us\n",
      "and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them\n",
      " and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines\n",
      "and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves\n",
      "  and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee\n",
      "and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock\n",
      "  and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his hands\n",
      "  and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith\n",
      "  and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men\n",
      "  and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place ramathlehi\n",
      "  and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised\n",
      "  but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day\n",
      "  and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years\n",
      " then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in unto her\n",
      " and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither\n",
      "and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him\n",
      " and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before hebron\n",
      " and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah\n",
      " and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver\n",
      " and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee\n",
      " and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man\n",
      " then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them\n",
      " now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber\n",
      "and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson\n",
      "and he brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire\n",
      "so his strength was not known\n",
      "  and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound\n",
      "  and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man\n",
      " delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson\n",
      "and there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber\n",
      "and he brake them from off his arms like a thread\n",
      "  and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound\n",
      "and he said unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web\n",
      "  and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson\n",
      "and he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web\n",
      "  and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me\n",
      "thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth\n",
      "  and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death   that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mother s womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man\n",
      "  and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath shewed me all his heart\n",
      "then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand\n",
      "  and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him\n",
      "  and she said the philistines be upon thee samson\n",
      "and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself\n",
      "and he wist not that the lord was departed from him\n",
      "  but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house\n",
      "  howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven\n",
      " then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand\n",
      "  and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us\n",
      "  and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for samson that he may make us sport\n",
      "and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars\n",
      "  and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them\n",
      "  now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport\n",
      "  and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes\n",
      "  and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left\n",
      "  and samson said let me die with the philistines\n",
      "and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein\n",
      "so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life\n",
      "  then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father\n",
      "and he judged israel twenty years\n",
      " and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah\n",
      " and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it\n",
      "and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son\n",
      " and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee\n",
      " yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah\n",
      " and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest\n",
      " in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes\n",
      " and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there\n",
      " and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed\n",
      " and micah said unto him whence comest thou\n",
      "and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place\n",
      "  and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals\n",
      "so the levite went in\n",
      "  and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons\n",
      " and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah\n",
      "  then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest\n",
      " in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel\n",
      " and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they lodged there\n",
      " when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him who brought thee hither\n",
      "and what makest thou in this place\n",
      "and what hast thou here\n",
      " and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest\n",
      " and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous\n",
      " and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein ye go\n",
      " then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with any man\n",
      " and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what say ye\n",
      " and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still\n",
      "be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land\n",
      "  when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth\n",
      "  and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of war\n",
      " and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it is behind kirjathjearim\n",
      "  and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah\n",
      "  then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image\n",
      "now therefore consider what ye have to do\n",
      "  and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him\n",
      "  and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate\n",
      "  and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war\n",
      "  and these went into micah s house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image\n",
      "then said the priest unto them what do ye\n",
      "  and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel\n",
      "  and the priest s heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people\n",
      "  so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them\n",
      "  and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micah s house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan\n",

      "and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company\n",
      "  and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more\n",
      "and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee\n",
      "  and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household\n",
      "  and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house\n",
      "  and they took the things which micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire\n",
      "  and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by bethrehob\n",
      "and they built a city and dwelt therein\n",

      "  and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land\n",
      "  and they set them up micah s graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh\n",
      " and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah\n",
      " and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her father s house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months\n",

      " and his father in law the damsel s father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there\n",
      " and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsel s father said unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way\n",
      " and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsel s father had said unto the man be content i pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry\n",
      " and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again\n",
      " and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsel s father said comfort thine heart i pray thee\n",
      "and they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them\n",
      " and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsel s father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home\n",
      "  but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him\n",
      "  and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it\n",
      " and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will pass over to gibeah\n",
      "  and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah\n",
      "  and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin\n",
      "  and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging\n",
      "  and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites\n",
      "  and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou\n",
      "and whence comest thou\n",
      "  and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord and there is no man that receiveth me to house\n",
      "  yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing\n",
      "  and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street\n",
      "  so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink\n",
      "  now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him\n",
      " and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly\n",
      "  behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing\n",
      "  but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go\n",
      "  then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the man s house where her lord was till it was light\n",
      "  and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold\n",
      "  and he said unto her up and let us be going\n",
      "but none answered\n",
      "then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place\n",
      "  and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel\n",
      "  and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and speak your minds\n",
      " then all the children of israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh\n",
      " and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword\n",
      " now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh \n",
      "then said the children of israel tell us how was this wickedness\n",
      " and the levite the husband of the woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge\n",
      " and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine have they forced that she is dead\n",
      " and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel\n",
      " behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and counsel\n",
      " and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house\n",
      " but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we will go up by lot against it   and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel\n",
      "  so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man\n",
      " and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you\n",
      "  now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel\n",
      "but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel\n",
      "  but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of israel\n",
      "  and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men\n",
      "  among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not miss\n",
      "  and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war\n",
      "  and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin\n",
      "and the lord said judah shall go up first\n",
      "  and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped against gibeah\n",
      "  and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah\n",
      "  and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men\n",
      "  and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day\n",
      " and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother\n",
      "and the lord said go up against him \n",
      "  and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day\n",
      "  and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword\n",
      "  then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord\n",

      "and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you\n",
      "and they answered him the lord bless thee\n",
      "then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this\n",
      "and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house\n",
      "then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter\n",
      "go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee\n",
      "and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn\n",
      " then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger\n",
      " and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore\n",
      "the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust\n",
      " then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens\n",
      " and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar\n",
      "and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left\n",
      " and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not  and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not\n",
      " so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley\n",
      " and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed\n",
      " and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day\n",
      "and where wroughtest thou\n",
      "blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee\n",
      "and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said the man s name with whom i wrought to day is boaz\n",
      " and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead\n",
      "and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmen\n",
      " and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest\n",
      " and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field\n",
      "so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law\n",
      "then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee\n",
      "and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast\n",
      "behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor\n",
      "wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking\n",
      "and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do\n",
      "and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do\n",
      "and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade her\n",
      "and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down\n",
      "and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet\n",
      "and he said who art thou\n",
      "and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman\n",
      " and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich\n",
      " and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman\n",
      "and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i\n",
      " tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsman s part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning\n",
      " and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another\n",
      "and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor\n",
      " also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it\n",
      "and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city\n",
      " and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou my daughter\n",
      "and she told her all that the man had done to her\n",
      " and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law\n",
      " then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day\n",
      "then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one\n",
      "turn aside sit down here\n",
      "and he turned aside and sat down\n",
      "and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here\n",
      "and they sat down\n",
      "and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimelech s and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people\n",
      "if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee\n",
      "and he said i will redeem it\n",
      "then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance\n",
      "and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it\n",
      "now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel\n",

      "so he drew off his shoe\n",

      "so samuel went and lay down in his place\n",
      " and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel\n",
      "then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth\n",

      "now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abiah they were judges in beersheba\n",
      "and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment\n",
      "then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations\n",
      "but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us\n",
      "and samuel prayed unto the lord\n",
      "and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them\n",
      "according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee\n",
      "now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them\n",
      " and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king\n",
      " and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots\n",
      "and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots\n",
      " and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers\n",
      " and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants\n",
      " and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants\n",
      " and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work\n",
      " he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants\n",
      " and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day\n",
      " nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us  that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles\n",
      " and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord\n",
      " and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king\n",
      "and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city\n",
      "now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power\n",
      "and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people\n",
      "and the asses of kish saul s father were lost\n",
      "and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses\n",
      "and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not\n",
      "and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us\n",
      "and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go\n",
      "then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man\n",
      "for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we\n",
      "and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way\n",
      "beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer \n",
      " then said saul to his servant well said come let us go\n",
      "so they went unto the city where the man of god was\n",
      " and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here\n",
      "and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place  as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden\n",
      "now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him\n",
      " and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place\n",
      " now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying  to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me\n",
      " and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of\n",
      "this same shall reign over my people\n",
      " then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seer s house is\n",
      " and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart\n",
      " and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found\n",
      "and on whom is all the desire of israel\n",
      "is it not on thee and on all thy father s house\n",
      " and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel\n",
      "and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin\n",
      "wherefore then speakest thou so to me\n",
      " and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons\n",
      "and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee\n",
      " and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul\n",
      "and samuel said behold that which is left\n",
      "set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people\n",
      "so saul did eat with samuel that day\n",
      " and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house\n",
      " and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away\n",
      "and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad\n",
      " and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on  but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god\n",
      " then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance\n",
      " when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachel s sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son\n",
      " then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine  and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands\n",
      " after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy  and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man\n",
      " and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee\n",
      " and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do\n",
      " and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day\n",
      "  and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them\n",
      "  and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish\n",
      "is saul also among the prophets\n",
      " and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father\n",
      "therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets\n",
      "  and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place\n",
      "  and saul s uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye\n",
      "and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel\n",
      "  and saul s uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you\n",
      "  and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found\n",
      "but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not\n",
      "  and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh   and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you   and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us\n",
      "now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands\n",
      "  and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken\n",
      "  when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found\n",
      "  therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither\n",
      "and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff\n",
      " and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward\n",
      "  and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people\n",
      "and all the people shouted and said god save the king\n",
      "  then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord\n",
      "and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house\n",
      "  and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched\n",
      "  but the children of belial said how shall this man save us\n",
      "and they despised him and brought no presents\n",
      "but he held his peace\n",
      " then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee\n",
      " and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel\n",
      " and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee\n",
      " then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept\n",
      " and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep\n",
      "and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh\n",
      " and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly\n",
      " and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen\n",
      "and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent\n",
      " and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand\n",
      " and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help\n",
      "and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh and they were glad\n",
      "  therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you\n",
      "  and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together\n",
      " and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us\n",
      "bring the men that we may put them to death\n",
      "  and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel\n",
      "  then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there\n",
      "  and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly\n",
      "and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you\n",
      "and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day\n",
      "behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken\n",
      "or whose ass have i taken\n",
      "or whom have i defrauded\n",
      "whom have i oppressed\n",
      "or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith\n",
      "and i will restore it you\n",
      "and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any man s hand\n",
      "and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand\n",
      "and they answered he is witness\n",
      "and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt\n",
      "now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers\n",
      "when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place\n",
      "and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them\n",
      " and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee\n",
      " and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe\n",
      "and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king\n",
      " now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired\n",
      "and behold the lord hath set a king over you\n",
      " if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god  but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers\n",
      " now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes\n",
      " is it not wheat harvest to day\n",
      "i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king\n",
      " so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel\n",
      " and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king\n",
      " and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart  and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain\n",
      " for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name s sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people\n",
      "moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way  only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you\n",
      " but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king\n",
      " saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel  saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent\n",
      " and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it\n",
      "and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear\n",
      " and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines\n",
      "and the people were called together after saul to gilgal\n",
      " and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven\n",
      " when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed  then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits\n",
      " and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead\n",
      "as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling\n",
      " and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him\n",
      " and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings\n",
      "and he offered the burnt offering\n",
      "  and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him\n",
      "  and samuel said what hast thou done\n",
      "and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash  therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering\n",
      "  and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever\n",
      "  but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee\n",
      "  and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin\n",
      "and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men\n",
      "  and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash\n",
      "  and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual   and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness\n",
      "  now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears   but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock\n",
      "  yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads\n",
      "  so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found\n",
      " and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash\n",
      " now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side\n",
      "but he told not his father\n",
      " and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men  and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabod s brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lord s priest in shiloh wearing an ephod\n",
      "and the people knew not that jonathan was gone\n",
      " and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh\n",
      " the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah\n",
      " and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few\n",
      " and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart\n",
      " then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them\n",
      " if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them\n",
      "  but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us\n",
      "  and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves\n",
      " and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing\n",
      "and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel\n",
      "  and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him\n",
      "  and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow\n",
      "  and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling\n",
      "  and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one another\n",
      "  then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us\n",
      "and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there\n",
      "  and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god\n",
      "for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel\n",
      "  and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand\n",
      "  and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every man s sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture\n",
      "  moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan\n",
      "  likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle\n",
      " so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven\n",
      "  and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies\n",
      "so none of the people tasted any food\n",
      "  and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground\n",
      "  and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath\n",
      "  but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened\n",
      "  then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day\n",
      "and the people were faint\n",
      "  then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey\n",
      "  how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found\n",
      "for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines\n",
      "  and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the people were very faint\n",
      "  and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood\n",
      "  then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood\n",
      "and he said ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day\n",
      " and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood\n",
      "and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there\n",
      "  and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord\n",
      "  and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them\n",
      "and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee\n",
      "then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god\n",
      "  and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines\n",
      "wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel\n",
      "but he answered him not that day\n",
      "  and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day\n",
      "  for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die\n",
      "but there was not a man among all the people that answered him\n",
      "  then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side\n",
      "and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee\n",
      "  therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect lot\n",
      "and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped\n",
      "  and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son\n",
      "and jonathan was taken\n",
      "  then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done\n",
      "and jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die\n",
      "  and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan\n",
      " and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel\n",
      "god forbid as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day\n",
      "so the people rescued jonathan that he died not\n",
      "  then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place\n",
      "  so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them\n",
      "  and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them\n",
      "  now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal   and the name of saul s wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner saul s uncle\n",
      "  and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel\n",
      "  and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto him\n",
      " samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord\n",
      " thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt\n",
      " now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass\n",
      " and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah\n",
      " and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley\n",
      " and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt\n",
      "so the kenites departed from among the amalekites\n",
      " and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur that is over against egypt\n",
      " and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword\n",
      " but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly\n",
      "  then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying   it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments\n",
      "and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night\n",
      " and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal\n",
      "  and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord\n",
      "  and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear\n",
      "  and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed\n",
      "  then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night\n",
      "and he said unto him say on\n",
      "  and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel\n",
      "  and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed\n",
      "  wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord\n",
      "  and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites\n",
      "  but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal\n",
      "  and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord\n",
      "behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams\n",
      " for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry\n",
      "because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king\n",
      "  and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice\n",
      "  now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord\n",
      "  and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel\n",
      "  and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent\n",
      "  and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou\n",
      "  and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent\n",
      "  then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god\n",
      "  so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord\n",
      "  then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites\n",
      "and agag came unto him delicately\n",
      "and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past\n",
      "  and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women\n",
      "and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal\n",
      " then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul\n",
      "  and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel\n",
      " and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel\n",
      "fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons\n",
      " and samuel said how can i go\n",
      "if saul hear it he will kill me\n",
      "and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord\n",
      " and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee\n",
      " and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem\n",
      "and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably\n",
      " and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice\n",
      "and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice\n",
      " and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lord s anointed is before him\n",
      " but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart\n",
      " then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel\n",
      "and he said neither hath the lord chosen this\n",
      " then jesse made shammah to pass by\n",
      "and he said neither hath the lord chosen this\n",
      "  again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel\n",
      "and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these\n",
      "  and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children\n",
      "and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep\n",
      "and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither\n",
      " and he sent and brought him in\n",
      "now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to\n",
      "and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he\n",
      "  then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward\n",
      "so samuel rose up and went to ramah\n",
      "  but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him\n",
      "  and saul s servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee\n",
      "  let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well\n",
      "  and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me\n",
      "  then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him\n",
      "  wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep\n",
      "  and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul\n",
      "  and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer\n",
      "  and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight\n",
      " and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him\n",
      " now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim\n",
      " and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines\n",
      " and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them\n",
      " and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span\n",
      " and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass\n",
      " and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders\n",
      " and the staff of his spear was like a weaver s beam and his spear s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him\n",
      " and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array\n",
      "am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul\n",
      "choose you a man for you and let him come down to me\n",
      " if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us\n",
      "  and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together\n",
      "  when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid\n",
      " now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul\n",
      "  and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah\n",
      "  and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul\n",
      "  but david went and returned from saul to feed his father s sheep at bethlehem\n",
      "  and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days\n",
      "  and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp of thy brethren   and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge\n",
      "  now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines\n",
      "  and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battle\n",
      "  for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army\n",
      "  and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren\n",
      " and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them\n",
      "  and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid\n",
      "  and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up\n",
      "surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father s house free in israel\n",
      "  and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel\n",
      "for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god\n",
      "  and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him\n",
      "  and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliab s anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither\n",
      "and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness\n",
      "i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle\n",
      "  and david said what have i now done\n",
      "is there not a cause\n",
      "  and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner\n",
      "  and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him\n",
      "  and david said to saul let no man s heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine\n",
      "  and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth\n",
      " and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father s sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock   and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him\n",
      "  thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god\n",
      "  david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine\n",
      "and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee\n",
      "  and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail\n",
      "  and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it\n",
      "and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them\n",
      "and david put them off him\n",
      "  and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd s bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine\n",
      "  and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him\n",
      "  and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance\n",
      "  and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves\n",
      "and the philistine cursed david by his gods\n",
      "  and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field\n",
      " then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied\n",
      "  this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel\n",
      "  and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord s and he will give you into our hands\n",
      "  and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine\n",
      "  and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth\n",
      "  so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david\n",
      "  therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith\n",
      "and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled\n",
      "  and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of ekron\n",
      "and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron\n",
      "  and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their tents\n",
      "  and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent\n",
      "  and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth\n",
      "and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell\n",
      " and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is\n",
      "  and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand\n",
      "  and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man\n",
      "and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite\n",
      " and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul\n",
      " and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father s house\n",
      " then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul\n",
      " and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle\n",
      " and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of saul s servants\n",
      " and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musick\n",
      " and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands\n",
      " and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom\n",
      " and saul eyed david from that day and forward\n",
      "  and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in saul s hand\n",
      "  and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it\n",
      "and david avoided out of his presence twice\n",
      " and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul\n",
      "  therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people\n",
      "  and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him\n",
      "  wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him\n",
      "  but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them\n",
      "  and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lord s battles\n",
      "for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him\n",
      "  and david said unto saul who am i\n",
      "and what is my life or my father s family in israel that i should be son in law to the king\n",
      "  but it came to pass at the time when merab saul s daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife\n",
      "  and michal saul s daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him\n",
      "  and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him\n",
      "wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain\n",
      "  and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the king s son in law\n",
      " and saul s servants spake those words in the ears of david\n",
      "and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king s son in law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed\n",
      "  and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david\n",
      "  and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the king s enemies\n",
      "but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines\n",
      "  and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the king s son in law and the days were not expired\n",
      "  wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the king s son in law\n",
      "and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife\n",
      "  and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that michal saul s daughter loved him\n",
      "  and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became david s enemy continually\n",
      "  then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by\n",
      " and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david\n",
      " but jonathan saul s son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself  and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee\n",
      " and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to thee ward very good  for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause\n",
      " and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain\n",
      " and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things\n",
      "and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past\n",
      " and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him\n",
      " and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand\n",
      "  and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of saul s presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night\n",
      "  saul also sent messengers unto david s house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal david s wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain\n",
      " so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped\n",
      "  and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth\n",
      "  and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick\n",
      "  and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him\n",
      "  and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster\n",
      "  and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped\n",
      "and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee\n",
      "  so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him\n",
      "and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth\n",
      "  and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah\n",
      "  and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied\n",
      "  and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise\n",
      "and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also\n",
      "  then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david\n",
      "and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah\n",
      " and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah\n",
      "  and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night\n",
      "wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets\n",
      " and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done\n",
      "what is mine iniquity\n",
      "and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life\n",
      " and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me\n",
      "it is not so\n",
      " and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death\n",
      " then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee\n",
      " and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even\n",
      " if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family\n",
      " if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him\n",
      " therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father\n",
      " and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee\n",
      "  then said david to jonathan who shall tell me\n",
      "or what if thy father answer thee roughly\n",
      "  and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field\n",
      "and they went out both of them into the field\n",
      " and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee   the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father\n",
      "  and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not   but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth\n",
      "  so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of david s enemies\n",
      "  and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul\n",
      "  then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty\n",
      "  and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel\n",
      "  and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark\n",
      "  and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows\n",
      "if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth\n",
      "  but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away\n",
      " and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever\n",
      "  so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meat\n",
      "  and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by saul s side and david s place was empty\n",
      "  nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean\n",
      "  and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that david s place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day\n",
      "  and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem   and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren\n",
      "therefore he cometh not unto the king s table\n",
      "  then saul s anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother s nakedness\n",
      "  for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom\n",
      "wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die\n",
      "  and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain\n",
      "what hath he done\n",
      "  and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david\n",
      " so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame\n",
      "  and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him\n",
      "  and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot\n",
      "and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him\n",
      "  and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee\n",
      "  and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not\n",
      "and jonathan s lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master\n",
      "  but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter\n",
      "  and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city\n",
      "  and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded\n",
      "  and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever\n",
      "and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city\n",
      " then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee\n",
      " and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place\n",
      " now therefore what is under thine hand\n",
      "give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present\n",
      " and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women\n",
      " and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel\n",
      " so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away\n",
      " now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul\n",
      " and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword\n",
      "for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king s business required haste\n",
      " and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here\n",
      "and david said there is none like that give it me\n",
      "  and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath\n",
      "  and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land\n",
      "did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands\n",
      " and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath\n",
      "  and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard\n",
      "  then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me\n",
      "  have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence\n",
      "shall this fellow come into my house\n",
      " david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his father s house heard it they went down thither to him\n",
      " and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men\n",
      " and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me\n",
      " and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold\n",
      " and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah\n",
      "then david departed and came into the forest of hareth\n",
      " when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him   then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds  that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day\n",
      " then answered doeg the edomite which was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub\n",
      "  and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine\n",
      "  then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his father s house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king\n",
      " and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub\n",
      "and he answered here i am my lord\n",
      "  and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day\n",
      "  then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the king s son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house\n",
      "  did i then begin to enquire of god for him\n",
      "be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more\n",
      "  and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy father s house\n",
      "  and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me\n",
      "but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord\n",
      "  and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests\n",
      "and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod\n",
      "  and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword\n",
      "  and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david\n",
      "  and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lord s priests\n",
      "  and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father s house\n",
      " abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard\n",
      "then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors\n",
      "therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines\n",
      "and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah\n",
      "and david s men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines\n",
      "then david enquired of the lord yet again\n",
      "and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand\n",
      "so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter\n",
      "so david saved the inhabitants of keilah\n",
      "and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand\n",
      "and it was told saul that david was come to keilah\n",
      "and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars\n",
      "and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men\n",
      "and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod\n",
      " then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake\n",
      " will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand\n",
      "will saul come down as thy servant hath heard\n",
      "o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant\n",
      "and the lord said he will come down\n",
      "then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul\n",
      "and the lord said they will deliver thee up\n",
      " then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go\n",
      "and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth\n",
      " and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph\n",
      "and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand\n",
      " and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood\n",
      " and jonathan saul s son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god\n",
      " and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth\n",
      " and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house\n",
      " then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon\n",
      " now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king s hand\n",
      " and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me\n",
      " go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly\n",
      "see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah\n",
      " and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon\n",
      " saul also and his men went to seek him\n",
      "and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon\n",
      "and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon\n",
      " and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them\n",
      " but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land\n",
      " wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth\n",
      " and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi\n",
      " and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi\n",
      " then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats\n",
      " and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave\n",
      " and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee\n",
      "then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul s robe privily\n",
      " and it came to pass afterward that david s heart smote him because he had cut off saul s skirt\n",
      " and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord s anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord\n",
      " so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul\n",
      "but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way\n",
      " david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king\n",
      "and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself\n",
      " and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou men s words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt\n",
      "  behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lord s anointed\n",
      "  moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it\n",
      " the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee\n",
      "  as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee\n",
      "  after whom is the king of israel come out\n",
      "after whom dost thou pursue\n",
      "after a dead dog after a flea\n",
      "  the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand\n",
      "  and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david\n",
      "and saul lifted up his voice and wept\n",
      "  and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil\n",
      "  and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not\n",
      "  for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away\n",
      "wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day\n",
      "  and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand\n",
      "  swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father s house\n",
      "  and david sware unto saul\n",
      "and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the hold\n",
      " and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah\n",
      "and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran\n",
      " and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel\n",
      " now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb\n",
      " and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep\n",
      " and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name  and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast\n",
      " and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel\n",
      " ask thy young men and they will shew thee\n",
      "wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david\n",
      " and when david s young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased\n",
      "  and nabal answered david s servants and said who is david\n",
      "and who is the son of jesse\n",
      "there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master\n",
      "  shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be\n",
      " so david s young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings\n",
      "  and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword\n",
      "and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff\n",
      "  but one of the young men told abigail nabal s wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them\n",
      "  but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields   they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep\n",
      "  now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him\n",
      "  then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses\n",
      "  and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you\n",
      "but she told not her husband nabal\n",
      "  and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them\n",
      "  now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good\n",
      "  so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall\n",
      " and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground   and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid\n",
      "  let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send\n",
      "  now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal\n",
      "  and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord\n",
      "  i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days\n",
      "  yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling\n",
      "  and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel   that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid\n",
      "  and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me   and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand\n",
      " for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall\n",
      "  so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person\n",
      "  and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabal s heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light\n",
      "  but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone\n",
      "  and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died\n",
      "  and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head\n",
      "and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife\n",
      "  and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife\n",
      "  and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord\n",
      "  and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife\n",
      "  david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of them his wives\n",
      "  but saul had given michal his daughter david s wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim\n",
      " and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon\n",
      " then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph\n",
      " and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way\n",
      "but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness\n",
      " david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come in very deed\n",
      " and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about him\n",
      " then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp\n",
      "and abishai said i will go down with thee\n",
      " so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him\n",
      " then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time\n",
      " and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lord s anointed and be guiltless\n",
      "  david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish\n",
      "  the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go\n",
      " so david took the spear and the cruse of water from saul s bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them\n",
      "  then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them   and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner\n",
      "then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king\n",
      "  and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man\n",
      "and who is like to thee in israel\n",
      "wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king\n",
      "for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord\n",
      "  this thing is not good that thou hast done\n",
      "as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lord s anointed\n",
      "and now see where the king s spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster\n",
      "  and saul knew david s voice and said is this thy voice my son david\n",
      "and david said it is my voice my lord o king\n",
      "  and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant\n",
      "for what have i done\n",
      "or what evil is in mine hand\n",
      "  now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant\n",
      "if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods\n",
      "  now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains\n",
      "  then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly\n",
      "  and david answered and said behold the king s spear\n",
      "and let one of the young men come over and fetch it\n",
      " the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed\n",
      "  and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation\n",
      "  then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail\n",
      "so david went on his way and saul returned to his place\n",
      " and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand\n",
      " and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath\n",

      " and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him\n",
      " and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee\n",
      " then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day\n",
      " and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months\n",
      " and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt\n",
      " and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish\n",
      "  and achish said whither have ye made a road to day\n",
      "and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites\n",
      "  and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines\n",
      " and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever\n",
      " and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel\n",
      "and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men\n",
      " and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do\n",
      "and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever\n",
      " now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city\n",
      "and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land\n",
      " and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa\n",
      " and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled\n",
      " and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets\n",
      " then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her\n",
      "and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor\n",
      " and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee\n",
      " and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die\n",
      "  and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing\n",
      "  then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee\n",
      "and he said bring me up samuel\n",
      " and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me\n",
      "for thou art saul\n",
      "  and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou\n",
      "and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth\n",
      "  and he said unto her what form is he of\n",
      "and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle\n",
      "and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself\n",
      "  and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up\n",
      "and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do\n",
      "  then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy\n",
      "  and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david   because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day\n",
      "  moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines\n",
      "  then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night\n",
      "  and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me\n",
      "  now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way\n",
      " but he refused and said i will not eat\n",
      "but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice\n",
      "so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed\n",
      "  and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof   and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat\n",
      "then they rose up and went away that night\n",
      " now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel\n",
      " and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish\n",
      " then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here\n",
      "and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day\n",
      " and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master\n",
      "should it not be with the heads of these men\n",
      " is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands\n",
      " then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not\n",
      " wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines\n",
      " and david said unto achish but what have i done\n",
      "and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king\n",
      " and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle\n",
      "  wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master s servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light depart\n",
      "  so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines\n",

      " and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire  and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way\n",
      " so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives\n",
      " then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep\n",
      " and david s two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite\n",
      " and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god\n",

      "and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david\n",

      "shall i overtake them\n",
      "and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all\n",
      " so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed\n",
      "  but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor\n",
      "  and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink water  and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights\n",
      "  and david said unto him to whom belongest thou\n",
      "and whence art thou\n",
      "and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick\n",
      "  we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire\n",
      "  and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company\n",
      "and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this company\n",
      "  and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah\n",
      "  and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled\n",
      "  and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives\n",
      "  and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david recovered all\n",
      "  and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is david s spoil\n",
      "  and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them\n",
      "  then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart\n",
      " then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand\n",
      "  for who will hearken unto you in this matter\n",
      "but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike\n",
      "  and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day\n",
      "  and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord   to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir   and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa   and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites   and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach   and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt\n",
      " now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa\n",

      "and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah\n",
      "and they told david saying that the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul\n",
      "and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him\n",
      "and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing\n",
      "therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them\n",
      "but abner the son of ner captain of saul s host took ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim and made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel\n",
      " ishbosheth saul s son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and reigned two years\n",
      "but the house of judah followed david\n",
      " and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months\n",
      "and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon\n",
      " and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool\n",
      " and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play before us\n",
      "and joab said let them arise\n",
      " then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david\n",
      " and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow s side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon\n",
      " and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david\n",
      " and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe\n",
      " and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner\n",
      " then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel\n",
      "and he answered i am\n",
      " and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour\n",
      "but asahel would not turn aside from following of him\n",
      " and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground\n",
      "how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother\n",
      "howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still\n",
      " joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon\n",
      " and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill\n",
      " then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever\n",
      "knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end\n",
      "how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren\n",
      " and joab said as god liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother\n",
      " so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more\n",
      " and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to mahanaim\n",
      " and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of david s servants nineteen men and asahel\n",
      " but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner s men so that three hundred and threescore men died\n",
      " and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem\n",
      "and joab and his men went all night and they came to hebron at break of day\n",
      "now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker\n",
      "and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital and the sixth ithream by eglah david s wife\n",
      "these were born to david in hebron\n",
      "and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house of saul\n",
      "and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father s concubine\n",
      "then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dog s head which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman\n",
      "so do god to abner and more also except as the lord hath sworn to david even so i do to him  to translate the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba\n",
      " and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him\n",
      "and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land\n",
      "saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee\n",
      " and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal saul s daughter when thou comest to see my face\n",
      " and david sent messengers to ishbosheth saul s son saying deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines\n",
      " and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish\n",
      " and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim\n",
      "then said abner unto him go return\n",
      "and he returned\n",
      " and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye sought for david in times past to be king over you  now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies\n",
      " and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin\n",
      " so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him\n",
      "and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast\n",
      " and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth\n",
      "and david sent abner away and he went in peace\n",
      " and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace\n",
      "when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace\n",
      " then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done\n",
      "behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone\n",
      " thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest\n",
      " and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not\n",
      " and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother\n",
      " and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner  let it rest on the head of joab and on all his father s house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread\n",
      " so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle\n",
      " and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner\n",
      "and king david himself followed the bier\n",
      " and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept\n",
      " and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth\n",
      "thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou\n",
      "and all the people wept again over him\n",
      " and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down\n",
      " and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people\n",
      " for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner\n",
      " and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel\n",
      " and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness\n",
      "and when saul s son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled\n",
      "and saul s son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin\n",
      "and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day \n",
      "and jonathan saul s son had a son that was lame of his feet\n",
      "he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame\n",
      "and his name was mephibosheth\n",
      "and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon\n",
      "and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped\n",
      "for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night\n",
      "and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed\n",
      "and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity  when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings  how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed\n",
      "shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth\n",
      "and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron\n",
      "but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron\n",
      "then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh\n",
      "also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel\n",
      "so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel\n",
      "david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years\n",
      "in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah\n",
      "and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither\n",
      "nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david\n",
      "and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of david s soul he shall be chief and captain\n",
      "wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house\n",
      "so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david\n",
      "and david built round about from millo and inward\n",
      " and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him\n",
      " and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house\n",
      "and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israel s sake\n",
      " and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david\n",
      " and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon  ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia  and elishama and eliada and eliphalet\n",
      " but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold\n",
      " the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim\n",
      " and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines\n",
      "wilt thou deliver them into mine hand\n",
      "and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand\n",
      " and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters\n",
      "therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim\n",
      " and there they left their images and david and his men burned them\n",
      " and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim\n",
      "and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees\n",
      " and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines\n",
      " and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer\n",
      "again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand\n",
      "and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims\n",
      "and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart\n",
      "and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark\n",
      "and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals\n",
      "and when they came to nachon s threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it\n",
      "and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god\n",
      "and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day\n",
      "and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me\n",
      " so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite\n",
      " and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household\n",
      "and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god\n",
      "so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness\n",
      " and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings\n",
      " and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod\n",
      " so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet\n",
      " and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal saul s daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart\n",
      " and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord\n",
      " and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts\n",
      " and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine\n",
      "so all the people departed every one to his house\n",
      " then david returned to bless his household\n",
      "and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself\n",
      " and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord\n",
      " and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour\n",
      "therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death\n",
      "and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains\n",
      "and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee\n",
      "and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in\n",
      "whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle\n",
      "in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar\n",
      "now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth\n",
      " moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime  and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies\n",
      "also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house\n",
      "and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom\n",
      " he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever\n",
      " i will be his father and he shall be my son\n",
      "if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men  but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee\n",
      " and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever\n",
      " according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david\n",
      " then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god\n",
      "and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto\n",
      " and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servant s house for a great while to come\n",
      "and is this the manner of man o lord god\n",
      " and what can david say more unto thee\n",
      "for thou lord god knowest thy servant\n",
      " for thy word s sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them\n",
      " wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears\n",
      "and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods\n",
      " for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art become their god\n",
      " and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast said\n",
      " and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee\n",
      " for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee\n",
      " and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant  therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever\n",
      "and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines\n",
      "and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive\n",
      "and so the moabites became david s servants and brought gifts\n",
      "david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates\n",

      "and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am\n",
      "then the king called to ziba saul s servant and said unto him i have given unto thy master s son all that pertained to saul and to all his house\n",
      " thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy master s son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy master s son shall eat bread alway at my table\n",

      " so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the king s table and was lame on both his feet\n",
      " and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead\n",

      "and david s servants came into the land of the children of ammon\n",
      " and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee\n",
      "hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it\n",
      " wherefore hanun took david s servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away\n",
      " when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return\n",
      " and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men\n",
      " and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men\n",
      " and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field\n",
      " when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians   and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon\n",
      "  and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee\n",
      " be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good\n",
      "  and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him\n",
      "  and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city\n",
      "so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem\n",
      "  and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together\n",
      "  and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them\n",
      "  and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam\n",
      "and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him\n",
      "  and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there\n",
      "  and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them\n",
      "so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more\n",
      " and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah\n",
      "but david tarried still at jerusalem\n",
      " and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king s house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon\n",
      " and david sent and enquired after the woman\n",
      "and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite\n",
      " and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house\n",
      " and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child\n",
      " and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite\n",
      "and joab sent uriah to david\n",
      " and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered\n",
      " and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet\n",
      "and uriah departed out of the king s house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king\n",
      " but uriah slept at the door of the king s house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house\n",
      "  and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey\n",
      "why then didst thou not go down unto thine house\n",
      "  and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife\n",
      "as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing\n",

      "so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow\n",
      "  and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house\n",
      "  and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah\n",
      "  and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die\n",
      "  and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were\n",
      "  and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also\n",
      "  then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war   and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king   and if so be that the king s wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight\n",
      "knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall\n",
      "  who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth\n",
      "did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez\n",
      "why went ye nigh the wall\n",
      "then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also\n",
      "  so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for\n",
      " and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate\n",
      "  and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the king s servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also\n",
      "  then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him\n",
      "  and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband\n",
      "  and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son\n",
      "but the thing that david had done displeased the lord\n",
      "and the lord sent nathan unto david\n",
      "and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor\n",
      "the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter\n",
      "and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man s lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him\n",
      "and david s anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity\n",
      "and nathan said to david thou art the man\n",
      "thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul and i gave thee thy master s house and thy master s wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things\n",
      "wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight\n",
      "thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon\n",
      " now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife\n",
      " thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun\n",
      "for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun\n",
      " and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord\n",
      "and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die\n",
      " howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die\n",
      " and nathan departed unto his house\n",
      "and the lord struck the child that uriah s wife bare unto david and it was very sick\n",
      " david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth\n",
      " and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them\n",
      " and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died\n",
      "and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead\n",
      " but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead\n",
      "and they said he is dead\n",
      " then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat\n",
      " then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done\n",
      "thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread\n",
      " and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live\n",
      "but now he is dead wherefore should i fast\n",
      "can i bring him back again\n",
      "i shall go to him but he shall not return to me\n",
      " and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him\n",
      " and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord\n",
      " and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city\n",
      " and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters\n",
      " now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name\n",
      " and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it\n",
      " and he took their king s crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on david s head\n",
      "and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance\n",
      " and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brick kiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon\n",
      "so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem\n",
      " and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her\n",
      " and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her\n",
      " but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah david s brother and jonadab was a very subtil man\n",
      " and he said unto him why art thou being the king s son lean from day to day\n",
      "wilt thou not tell me\n",
      "and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absalom s sister\n",
      " and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand\n",
      " so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand\n",
      " then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnon s house and dress him meat\n",
      " so tamar went to her brother amnon s house and he was laid down\n",
      "and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes\n",
      " and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat\n",
      "and amnon said have out all men from me\n",
      "and they went out every man from him\n",
      "  and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand\n",
      "and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother\n",
      "  and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister\n",
      " and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly\n",
      "  and i whither shall i cause my shame to go\n",
      "and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel\n",
      "now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee\n",
      "  howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her\n",
      "  then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her\n",
      "and amnon said unto her arise be gone\n",
      "  and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me\n",
      "but he would not hearken unto her\n",
      "  then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her\n",
      "  and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the king s daughters that were virgins apparelled\n",
      "then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her\n",
      "  and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying\n",
      "  and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee\n",
      "but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing\n",
      "so tamar remained desolate in her brother absalom s house\n",
      "  but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth\n",
      "  and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar\n",
      " and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the king s sons\n",
      "  and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant\n",
      "  and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee\n",
      "and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him\n",
      "  then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us\n",
      "and the king said unto him why should he go with thee\n",
      "  but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the king s sons go with him\n",
      "  now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnon s heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you\n",
      "be courageous and be valiant\n",
      "  and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded\n",
      "then all the king s sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled\n",
      "  and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the king s sons and there is not one of them left\n",
      "  then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent\n",
      "  and jonadab the son of shimeah david s brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king s sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar\n",
      "  now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king s sons are dead for amnon only is dead\n",
      " but absalom fled\n",
      "and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him\n",
      "  and jonadab said unto the king behold the king s sons come as thy servant said so it is\n",
      "  and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the king s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore\n",
      "  but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur\n",
      "and david mourned for his son every day\n",
      "  so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years\n",
      "  and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead\n",
      " now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the king s heart was toward absalom\n",
      " and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead  and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him\n",
      "so joab put the words in her mouth\n",
      " and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king\n",
      " and the king said unto her what aileth thee\n",
      "and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead\n",
      " and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him\n",
      " and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth\n"

      "  but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron\n",
      "  and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing\n",
      " and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite david s counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices\n",
      "and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom\n",
      "  and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom\n",
      "  and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword\n",
      "  and the king s servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint\n",
      "  and the king went forth and all his household after him\n",
      "and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house\n",
      "  and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off\n",
      "  and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king\n",
      "  then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us\n",
      "return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile\n",
      "  whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us\n",
      "seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee\n",
      "  and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be\n",
      "  and david said to ittai go and pass over\n",
      "and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him\n",
      " and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness\n",
      "  and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city\n",
      "  and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation   but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him\n",
      "  the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer\n",
      "return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar\n",
      "  see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me\n",
      "  zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there\n",
      "  and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up\n",
      "  and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom\n",
      "and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness\n",
      "  and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head   unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me  but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy father s servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel\n",
      "  and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests\n",
      "therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king s house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests\n",
      "  behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadok s son and jonathan abiathar s son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear\n",
      "  so hushai david s friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem\n",
      " and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine\n",
      " and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these\n",
      "and ziba said the asses be for the king s household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink\n",
      " and the king said and where is thy master s son\n",
      "and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father\n",
      " then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth\n",
      "and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king\n",
      " and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came\n",
      " and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left\n",
      " and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial  the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man\n",
      " then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king\n",
      "let me go over i pray thee and take off his head\n",
      "  and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah\n",
      "so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david\n",
      "who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so\n",
      "  and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it\n",
      "let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him\n",
      " it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day\n",
      "  and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hill s side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust\n",
      "  and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there\n",
      "  and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him\n",
      "  and it came to pass when hushai the archite david s friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king\n",
      "  and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend\n",
      "why wentest thou not with thy friend\n",
      "  and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide\n",
      "  and again whom should i serve\n",
      "should i not serve in the presence of his son\n",
      "as i have served in thy father s presence so will i be in thy presence\n",
      "  then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do\n",
      "  and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy father s concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong\n",
      "  so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his father s concubines in the sight of all israel\n",
      " and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom\n",
      " moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night  and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only  and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace\n",
      " and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel\n",
      " then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith\n",
      " and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying\n",
      "if not speak thou\n",
      " and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time\n",
      " for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people\n",
      " behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom\n",
      "  and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men\n",
      "  therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person\n",
      " so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one\n",
      "  moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there\n",
      "  and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel\n",
      "for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom\n",
      "  then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled\n",
      "  now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him\n",
      "  now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david\n",
      "  nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a man s house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down\n",
      "  and the woman took and spread a covering over the well s mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known\n",
      "  and when absalom s servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan\n",
      "and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water\n",
      "and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem\n",
      "  and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you\n",
      "  then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan\n",
      " and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father\n",
      "  then david came to mahanaim\n",
      "and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him\n",
      "  and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a man s son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joab s mother\n",
      "  so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead\n",
      "  and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim   brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse   and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness\n",
      " and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them\n",
      " and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joab s brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite\n",
      "and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also\n",
      " but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city\n",
      " and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do\n",
      "and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands\n",
      " and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom\n",
      "and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom\n",
      " so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim  where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men\n",
      " for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured\n",
      " and absalom met the servants of david\n",
      "and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away\n",
      "  and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak\n",
      "  and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground\n",
      "and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle\n",
      " and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the king s son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom\n",
      "  otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me\n",
      "  then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee\n",
      "and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak\n",
      "  and ten young men that bare joab s armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him\n",
      "  and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people\n",
      "  and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent\n",
      "  now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the king s dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absalom s place\n",
      "  then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies\n",
      "  and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king s son is dead\n",
      "  then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen\n",
      "and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran\n",
      "  then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi\n",
      "and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready\n",
      " but howsoever said he let me run\n",
      "and he said unto him run\n",
      "then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi\n",
      "  and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone\n",
      "  and the watchman cried and told the king\n",
      "and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth\n",
      "and he came apace and drew near\n",
      "  and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone\n",
      "and the king said he also bringeth tidings\n",
      "  and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok\n",
      "and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings\n",
      "  and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well\n",
      "and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king\n",
      "  and the king said is the young man absalom safe\n",
      "and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the king s servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was\n",
      "  and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here\n",
      "and he turned aside and stood still\n",
      "  and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee\n",
      "  and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe\n",
      "and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is\n",
      "  and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom\n",
      "would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son\n",
      " and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom\n",
      " and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son\n",
      " and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle\n",
      " but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son\n",
      " and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines  in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends\n",
      "for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well\n",
      " now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now\n",
      " then the king arose and sat in the gate\n",
      "and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate\n",
      "and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent\n",
      " and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom\n",
      "  and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle\n",
      "now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back\n",
      "  and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house\n",
      "seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house\n",
      " ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king\n",
      "  and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh\n",
      "god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab\n",
      "  and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants\n",
      "  so the king returned and came to jordan\n",
      "and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan\n",
      "  and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david\n",
      "  and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king\n",
      "  and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king s household and to do what he thought good\n",
      "and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan   and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart\n",
      "  for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king\n",
      "  but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lord s anointed\n",
      "  and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me\n",
      "shall there any man be put to death this day in israel\n",
      "for do not i know that i am this day king over israel\n",
      " therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die\n",
      "and the king sware unto him\n",
      "  and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace\n",
      "  and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth\n",
      "  and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame\n",
      "  and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes\n",
      "  for all of my father s house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table\n",
      "what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king\n",
      "  and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters\n",
      "i have said thou and ziba divide the land\n",
      "  and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house\n",
      "  and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan\n",
      "  now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man\n",
      "  and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem\n",
      " and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem\n",
      "  i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil\n",
      "can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink\n",
      "can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women\n",
      "wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king\n",
      "  thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward\n",
      "  let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother\n",
      "but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee\n",
      "  and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee\n",
      "  and all the people went over jordan\n",
      "and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place\n",
      "  then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel\n",
      "  and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all david s men with him over jordan\n",
      "  and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter\n",
      "have we eaten at all of the king s cost\n",
      "or hath he given us any gift\n",
      "  and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king\n",
      "and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel\n",
      " and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel\n",
      " so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem\n",
      " and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them\n",
      "so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood\n",
      " then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present\n",
      " so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him\n",
      " and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lord s servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us\n",
      " and there went out after him joab s men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri\n",
      " when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them\n",

      " and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel  let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose\n",

      " the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon\n",
      " then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah\n",
      " and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too\n",
      " as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david\n",
      " so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king david s mule and brought him to gihon\n",
      " and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon\n",
      "and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon\n",
      " and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them\n",
      " and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating\n",
      "and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar\n",
      " and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings\n",
      " and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king\n",
      " and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the king s mule and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again\n",
      "this is the noise that ye have heard\n",
      " and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom\n",
      " and moreover the king s servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne\n",
      "and the king bowed himself upon the bed\n",
      " and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it\n",
      " and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way\n",
      " and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar\n",
      " and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword\n",
      " and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die\n",
      " so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar\n",
      "and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house\n",
      "now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel\n",
      "moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet\n",
      "do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace\n",
      "but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother\n",
      "and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword\n",
      "now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood\n",
      " so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david\n",
      " and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem\n",
      "then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly\n",
      " and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon\n",
      "and she said comest thou peaceably\n",
      "and he said peaceably\n",
      " he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee\n",
      "and she said say on\n",
      " and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother s for it was his from the lord\n",
      " and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not\n",
      "and she said unto him say on\n",
      " and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay  that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife\n",
      " and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king\n",
      " bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah\n",
      "and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king s mother and she sat on his right hand\n",
      " then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay\n",
      "and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay\n",
      " and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife\n",
      " and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah\n",
      "ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah\n",
      "then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life\n",
      " now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day\n",
      " and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died\n",
      " and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted\n",
      " so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh\n",
      " then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom\n",
      "and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar\n",
      " and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar\n",
      "then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him\n",
      " and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth\n",
      "and he said nay but i will die here\n",
      "and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me\n",
      " and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father\n",
      " and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah\n",
      " their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord\n",
      "so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness\n",
      " and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar\n",
      " and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither\n",
      " for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head\n",
      " and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do\n",
      "and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days\n",
      " and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath\n",
      "and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath\n",
      " and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath\n",
      " and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again\n",
      " and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die\n",
      "and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good\n",
      " why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with\n",
      " the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever\n",
      " so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died\n",
      "and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon\n",
      "and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaoh s daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about\n",
      "only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days\n",
      "and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places\n",
      "and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar\n",
      "in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee\n",
      "and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day\n",
      "and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in\n",
      "and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude\n",
      "give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people\n",
      " and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing\n",
      " and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee\n",
      " and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days\n",
      " and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days\n",
      " and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream\n",
      "and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants\n",
      " then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him\n",
      " and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house\n",
      " and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house\n",
      " and this woman s child died in the night because she overlaid it\n",
      " and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom\n",
      " and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear\n",
      " and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son\n",
      "and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son\n",
      "thus they spake before the king\n",
      "then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living\n",
      " and the king said bring me a sword\n",
      "and they brought a sword before the king\n",
      " and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other\n",
      " then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it\n",
      "but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it\n",
      " then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof\n",
      " and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment\n",
      "so king solomon was king over all israel\n",
      "and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder\n",
      "and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were the priests and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and the king s friend and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute\n",
      "and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision\n",

      " and solomon s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl\n",
      " for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him\n",
      " and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon\n",
      " and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen\n",

      " barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his charge\n",
      " and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore\n",
      " and solomon s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt\n",
      " for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about\n",
      " and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five\n",
      " and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes\n",
      "and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom\n",
      "and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david\n",

      " and solomon s builders and hiram s builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house\n",
      "and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomon s reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord\n",

      "and for the house he made windows of narrow lights\n",
      "and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house\n",
      "and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building\n",
      "the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third\n",
      "so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar\n",
      " and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar\n",
      " and the word of the lord came to solomon saying concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father  and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel\n",
      " so solomon built the house and finished it\n",
      " and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir\n",
      " and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place\n",

      " and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar\n",
      " so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold\n",
      " and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold\n",
      "and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits high\n",

      " the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub\n",
      " and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house\n",
      " and he overlaid the cherubims with gold\n",
      " and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and without\n",
      " and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within and without\n",
      " and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall\n",
      " the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees\n",
      " so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall\n",
      "and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding\n",
      " and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work\n",
      " and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams\n",
      " in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif  and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it\n",
      "so was he seven years in building it\n",
      "but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house\n",
      "he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars\n",
      "and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a row\n",
      "and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks\n",
      "and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranks\n",
      "and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them\n",
      "then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other\n",
      "and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work\n",
      "solomon made also an house for pharaoh s daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch\n",
      "all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great court\n",
      " and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits\n",
      " and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars\n",
      "and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the lord and for the porch of the house\n",
      " and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre\n",
      " he was a widow s son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass\n",
      "and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work\n",
      " for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about\n",
      " and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits  and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter\n",
      " and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter\n",
      " and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubits\n",
      " and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter\n",
      " and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz\n",
      " and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished\n",
      "and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about\n",
      " and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was cast\n",
      " it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward\n",
      " and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths\n",
      " and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it\n",
      " and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges  and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work\n",
      " and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition\n",
      " and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round\n",
      " and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit\n",
      " and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten\n",

      " and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same\n",
      " for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about\n",
      " after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one size\n",
      " then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver\n",
      " and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south\n",

      "so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord  the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars  and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases  and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass\n",
      " in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan\n",

      "and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the levites bring up\n",
      "and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude\n",
      "and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims\n",
      "for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above\n",
      "and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day\n",
      "there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt\n",
      " and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord  so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord\n",
      "then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness\n",
      " i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever\n",
      " and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood   and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying  since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel\n",
      " and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel\n",

      " and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart  who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day\n",

      "so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord\n",
      " the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings\n",

      " on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel his people\n",
      "and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the king s house and all solomon s desire which he was pleased to do that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon\n",
      "and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually\n",

      "but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house\n",
      "and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil\n",
      " and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the king s house  now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire  that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee\n",
      "and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not\n",
      " and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother\n",
      "and he called them the land of cabul unto this day\n",
      " and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold\n",
      " and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer\n",
      " for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomon s wife\n",
      " and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether  and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land  and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion\n",
      " and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel  their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day\n",
      " but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen\n",
      "these were the chief of the officers that were over solomon s work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work\n",
      " but pharaoh s daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo\n",
      " and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord\n",
      "so he finished the house\n",
      " and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom\n",
      " and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon\n",

      " and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomon s wisdom and the house that he had built  and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her\n",
      " and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom\n",
      " howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard\n",
      " happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom\n",
      " blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice\n",
      "  and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon\n",
      "  and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones\n",
      " and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the king s house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day\n",
      "  and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty\n",
      "so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants\n",
      "  now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold   beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country\n",
      "  and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target\n",
      "  and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon\n",
      "  moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold\n",
      "  the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays\n",
      "  and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom\n",
      "  and all king solomon s drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon\n",
      "  for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks\n",
      " so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom\n",
      "  and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart\n",

      "  and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance\n",
      "  and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price\n",
      "  and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means\n",
      " but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites  of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love\n",
      " and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart\n",
      " for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father\n",
      " for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites\n",
      " and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father\n",
      " then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon\n",
      " and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods\n",
      " and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice   and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded\n",
      "  wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant\n",

      "  howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servant s sake and for jerusalem s sake which i have chosen\n",
      "  and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the king s seed in edom\n",
      "  for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom   for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom    that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his father s servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child\n",
      "  and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land\n",
      "  and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen\n",
      "  and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaoh s house and genubath was in pharaoh s household among the sons of pharaoh\n",
      "  and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country\n",
      "  then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country\n",
      "and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise\n",
      " and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah   and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus\n",
      "  and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria\n",
      "  and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomon s servant whose mother s name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king\n",

      "  and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him\n",
      "  and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria\n",
      "  and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him\n",
      " in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun\n",
      " and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word\n",
      " and the word of the lord came unto him saying  get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan\n",
      " and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there\n",
      " so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan\n",
      " and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook\n",
      " and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land\n",
      " and the word of the lord came unto him saying  arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee\n",
      "  so he arose and went to zarephath\n",
      "and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink\n",
      "  and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand\n",
      " and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die\n",
      "  and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth\n",
      "  and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days\n",
      "  and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah\n",
      "  and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him\n",
      "  and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god\n",
      "art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son\n",
      "  and he said unto her give me thy son\n",
      "and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed\n",
      "  and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son\n",
      "  and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this child s soul come into him again\n",
      "  and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived\n",
      " and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth\n",
      "  and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth\n",
      " and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth\n",
      " and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab\n",
      "and there was a sore famine in samaria\n",
      " and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house\n",
      "now obadiah feared the lord greatly  for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water \n",
      " and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts\n",
      " so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself\n",
      " and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah\n",
      " and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here\n",
      " and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me\n",
      "  as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not\n",
      "  and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here\n",
      " and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth\n",
      "  was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lord s prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water\n",
      "  and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me\n",
      "  and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day\n",
      "  so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah\n",
      "  and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel\n",
      "  and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy father s house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim\n",
      "  now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebel s table\n",
      "  so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel\n",
      "  and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions\n",
      "if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him\n",
      "and the people answered him not a word\n",
      "  then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal s prophets are four hundred and fifty men\n",
      " let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under   and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god\n",
      "and all the people answered and said it is well spoken\n",
      "  and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under\n",
      "  and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us\n",
      "but there was no voice nor any that answered\n",
      "and they leaped upon the altar which was made\n",
      "  and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked\n",
      "  and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them\n",
      "  and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded\n",
      "  and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me\n",
      "and all the people came near unto him\n",
      "and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down\n",
      "  and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name   and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed\n",
      "  and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood\n",
      " and he said do it the second time\n",
      "and they did it the second time\n",
      "and he said do it the third time\n",
      "and they did it the third time\n",
      "  and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water\n",
      "  and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word\n",
      "  hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again\n",
      "  then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench\n",
      "  and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god\n",
      "  and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape\n",
      "and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there\n",
      "  and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain\n",
      "  so ahab went up to eat and to drink\n",
      "and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees   and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea\n",
      "and he went up and looked and said there is nothing\n",
      "and he said go again seven times\n",
      "  and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man s hand\n",
      "and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not\n",
      " and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain\n",
      "and ahab rode and went to jezreel\n",
      "  and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel\n",
      " and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword\n",
      " then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time\n",
      " and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there\n",
      " but he himself went a day s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers\n",
      " and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat\n",
      " and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head\n",
      "and he did eat and drink and laid him down again\n",
      " and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee\n",
      " and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god\n",
      " and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah\n",
      "  and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away\n",
      "  and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord\n",
      "and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake  and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice\n",
      "  and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave\n",
      "and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah\n",
      "  and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away\n",
      "  and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king over syria   and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room\n",
      "  and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay\n",
      "  yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him\n",
      "  so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him\n",
      "  and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee\n",
      "and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee\n",
      "  and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat\n",
      "then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him\n",
      " and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it\n",
      " and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad  thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine\n",
      " and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have\n",
      " and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children  yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away\n",
      " then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not\n",
      " and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent\n",
      " wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do\n",
      "and the messengers departed and brought him word again\n",
      "  and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me\n",
      "  and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off\n",
      " and it came to pass when ben hadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array\n",
      "and they set themselves in array against the city\n",
      "  and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude\n",
      "behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord\n",
      "  and ahab said by whom\n",
      "and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces\n",
      "then he said who shall order the battle\n",
      "and he answered thou\n",
      "  then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand\n",
      "  and they went out at noon\n",
      "but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him\n",
      "  and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria\n",
      "  and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive\n",
      "  so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them\n",
      "  and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen\n",
      "  and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter\n",
      "  and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee\n",
      " and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they\n",
      "  and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms   and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they\n",
      "and he hearkened unto their voice and did so\n",
      "  and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel\n",
      "  and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country\n",
      "  and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord\n",
      "  and they pitched one over against the other seven days\n",
      "and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day\n",
      "  but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left\n",
      "and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber\n",
      "  and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life\n",
      "  so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live\n",
      "and he said is he yet alive\n",
      "he is my brother\n",
      "  now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad\n",
      "then he said go ye bring him\n",
      "then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot\n",
      " and ben hadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria\n",
      "then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant\n",
      "so he made a covenant with him and sent him away\n",
      "  and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee\n",
      "and the man refused to smite him\n",
      "  then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee\n",
      "and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him\n",
      "  then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee\n",
      "and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him\n",
      "  so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face\n",
      "  and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver\n",
      "  and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone\n",
      "and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it\n",
      "  and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets\n",
      "  and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people\n",
      "  and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria\n",
      " and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria\n",
      " and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money\n",
      " and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee\n",
      " and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers\n",
      "and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread\n",
      " but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread\n",
      " and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard\n",
      " and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel\n",
      "arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite\n",
      " so she wrote letters in ahab s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth\n",
      " and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people   and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king\n",
      "and then carry him out and stone him that he may die\n",
      "  and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them\n",
      " they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people\n",
      "  and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king\n",
      "then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died\n",
      "  then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead\n",
      "  and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead\n",
      "  and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it\n",
      "  and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying   arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it\n",
      "  and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession\n",
      "and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine\n",
      "  and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy\n",
      "and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord\n",
      "  behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel   and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin\n",
      " and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel\n",
      "  him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat\n",
      "  but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up\n",
      "  and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel\n",

      " and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him\n",
      " and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil\n",
      "and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so\n",
      " then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah\n",
      "  and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them\n",
      "  and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them\n",

      "  and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord\n",
      "  and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace\n",
      "  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil\n",
      "  and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left\n",

      "and one said on this manner and another said on that manner\n",
      "  and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him\n",
      "  and the lord said unto him wherewith\n",
      "and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets\n",
      "and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and do so\n",
      " now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee\n",
      "  but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee\n",
      "  and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself\n",
      "  and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son   and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace\n",
      "  and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me\n",
      "and he said hearken o people every one of you\n",
      "  so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead\n",

      "  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel\n",
      "and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out\n",
      "  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him\n",
      " and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded\n",
      "  and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot\n",
      "  and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country\n",

      "  five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem\n",
      "and his mother s name was jerusha the daughter of zadok\n",
      " and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did according to all that his father uzziah had done\n",
      "  howbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places\n",
      "he built the higher gate of the house of the lord\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\n",
      "  in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah\n",

      " but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel\n",
      " and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree\n",
      " then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him\n",
      " at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day\n",
      " so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me\n",
      " and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king s house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria\n",
      " and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin\n",
      "  and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof\n",
      "  and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king ahaz came from damascus\n",
      " and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon\n",
      "  and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar\n",
      "  and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar\n",
      "  and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat offering and the king s burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by\n",
      "  thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded\n",
      "  and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones\n",
      "  and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king s entry without turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah\n",
      "  and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years\n",
      " and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not as the kings of israel that were before him\n",
      " against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and gave him presents\n",
      " and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison\n",
      " then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years\n",
      " in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes\n",
      " for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods  and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they had made\n",
      " and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city\n",
      "  and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree   and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger  for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing\n",
      "  yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets\n",
      "  notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord their god\n",
      "  and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had charged them that they should not do like them\n",
      "  and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal\n",
      "  and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger\n",
      "  therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only\n",
      "  also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made\n",
      "  and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight\n",
      "  for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord and made them sin a great sin\n",
      "  for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them  until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets\n",
      "so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day\n",
      "  and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof\n",
      "  and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which slew some of them\n",
      "  wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land\n",
      "  then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land\n",
      "  then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord\n",
      "  howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt\n",
      "  and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima   and the avites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim\n",
      "  so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places\n",
      "  they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence\n",
      " unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel   with whom the lord had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them   but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice\n",
      "  and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods\n",
      "  and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods\n",
      "  but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies\n",
      "  howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner\n",
      "  so these nations feared the lord and served their graven images both their children and their children s children as did their fathers so do they unto this day\n",
      " now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign\n",
      " twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem\n",
      "his mother s name also was abi the daughter of zachariah\n",
      " and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did\n",
      " he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan\n",
      " he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him\n",
      " for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses\n",
      " and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not\n",
      " he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city\n",
      " and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it\n",
      "  and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken\n",
      "  and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes  because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them\n",
      "  now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took them\n",
      "  and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear\n",
      "and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold\n",
      "  and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the king s house\n",
      "  at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria\n",
      "  and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem\n",
      "and they went up and came to jerusalem\n",
      "and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fuller s field\n",
      "  and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder\n",
      "  and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest\n",
      "  thou sayest but they are but vain words  i have counsel and strength for the war\n",
      "now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me\n",
      "  now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him\n",
      "  but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem\n",
      " now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them\n",
      "  how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen\n",

      "the lord said to me go up against this land and destroy it\n",
      "  then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall\n",
      "  but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words\n",
      "hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you\n",
      "  then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria   thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand   neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria\n",
      "  hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern   until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us\n",
      "  hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria\n",
      " where are the gods of hamath and of arpad\n",
      "where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivah\n",
      "have they delivered samaria out of mine hand\n",
      "  who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand\n",
      "  but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the king s commandment was saying answer him not\n",
      "  then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh\n",
      " and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord\n",
      " and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz\n",

      " it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left\n",
      " so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah\n",
      " and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me\n",
      " behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land\n",
      " so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish\n",
      " and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying   thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria\n",
      "  behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered\n",
      " have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in thelasar\n",
      "  where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah\n",
      "  and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord\n",
      "  and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth\n",
      "  lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god\n",
      "  of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands   and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men s hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them\n",
      "  now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only\n",
      "  then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard\n",
      "  this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee\n",
      "  whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed\n",
      "and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high\n",
      "even against the holy one of israel\n",
      " by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel\n",
      "  i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places\n",
      "  hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it\n",
      "now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps\n",
      "  therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up\n",
      "  but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me\n",
      "  because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest\n",
      "  and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof\n",
      "  and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward\n",
      "  for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this\n",
      "  therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it\n",
      "  by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord\n",
      " for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant david s sake\n",
      "  and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses\n",
      "  so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh\n",

      "and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live\n",
      " then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying  i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight\n",
      "and hezekiah wept sore\n",
      " and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying  turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord\n",

      "and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered\n",
      " and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day\n",
      " and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees\n",
      "  and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees\n",
      "  and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz\n",
      " at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick\n",

      "  then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men\n",

      "and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon\n",
      "  and he said what have they seen in thine house\n",
      "and hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them\n",

      " for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them\n",
      " and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name\n",
      " and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord\n",
      " and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger\n",

      "  and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab  and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it\n",
      "  for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order\n",
      "  so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel\n",
      "  and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord\n",
      "  and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy\n",
      "  so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah   and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the porters\n",
      "  so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass   and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries on alamoth   and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to excel\n",
      "  and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilful\n",
      " and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark\n",
      "  and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark\n",
      "  so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy\n",
      "  and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams\n",
      "  and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of linen\n",
      "  thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps\n",
      "  and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart\n",
      " so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god\n",
      " and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord\n",
      " and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine\n",
      " and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel  asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals  benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god\n",
      " then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren\n",
      " give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people\n",
      " sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works\n",
      "  glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord\n",
      "  seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually\n",
      " remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth   o ye seed of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones\n",
      "  he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth\n",
      "  be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generations   even of the covenant which he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac   and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant   saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance   when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it\n",
      "  and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people   he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes   saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm\n",
      " sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvation\n",
      "  declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nations\n",
      "  for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods\n",
      "  for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens\n",
      "  glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place\n",
      "  give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength\n",
      "  give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness\n",
      "  fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved\n",
      "  let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations the lord reigneth\n",
      "  let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein\n",
      "  then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth\n",
      " o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever\n",
      "  and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise\n",
      "  blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever\n",
      "and all the people said amen and praised the lord\n",
      "  so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day s work required   and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters   and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon   to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel   and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever   and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god\n",
      "and the sons of jeduthun were porters\n",
      "  and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house\n",
      " now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains\n",
      " then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee\n",
      " and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying  go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in  for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another\n",
      " wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me an house of cedars\n",
      " now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel  and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth\n",
      " also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginning   and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel\n",
      "moreover i will subdue all thine enemies\n",
      "furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house\n",
      "  and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom\n",
      " he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for ever\n",
      "  i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee   but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermore\n",
      "  according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david\n",
      "  and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto\n",
      "  and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou hast also spoken of thy servant s house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o lord god\n",
      "  what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant\n",
      "for thou knowest thy servant\n",
      "  o lord for thy servant s sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great things\n",
      "  o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears\n",
      "  and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt\n",
      "  for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god\n",
      " therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said\n",
      "  let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee\n",
      "  for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee\n",
      "  and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant   now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever\n",
      " now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines\n",
      " and he smote moab and the moabites became david s servants and brought gifts\n",
      " and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates\n",
      " and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots\n",
      " and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men\n",
      " then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became david s servants and brought gifts\n",
      "thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went\n",
      " and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem\n",
      " likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass\n",
      " now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah   he sent hadoram his son to king david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war with tou  and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass\n",
      "  them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek\n",
      " moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand\n",
      "  and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became david s servants\n",
      "thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went\n",
      "  so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people\n",
      "  and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder\n",
      "  and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and shavsha was scribe   and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king\n",
      " now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me\n",
      "and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father\n",
      "so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him\n",
      " but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee\n",
      "are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land\n",
      " wherefore hanun took david s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away\n",
      " then there went certain and told david how the men were served\n",
      "and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed\n",
      "and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return\n",
      " and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah\n",
      " so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba\n",
      "and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle\n",
      " and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men\n",
      " and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field\n",
      "  now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrians\n",
      "  and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon\n",
      " and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee\n",
      "  be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that which is good in his sight\n",
      "  so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him\n",
      "  and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city\n",
      "then joab came to jerusalem\n",
      "  and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them\n",
      "  and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them\n",
      "so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him\n",
      "  but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host\n",
      "  and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more\n",
      " and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah\n",
      "but david tarried at jerusalem\n",
      "and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it\n",
      " and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon david s head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city\n",
      " and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes\n",
      "even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon\n",
      "and david and all the people returned to jerusalem\n",
      " and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued\n",
      " and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff was like a weaver s beam\n",
      " and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant\n",
      " but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea david s brother slew him\n",
      " these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants\n",
      " and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel\n",
      " and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that i may know it\n",
      " and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lord s servants\n",
      "why then doth my lord require this thing\n",
      "why will he be a cause of trespass to israel\n",
      " nevertheless the king s word prevailed against joab\n",
      "wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem\n",
      " and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david\n",
      "and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword\n",
      " but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the king s word was abominable to joab\n",
      " and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel\n",
      " and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly\n",
      " and the lord spake unto gad david s seer saying   go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee\n",
      "  so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee  either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel\n",
      "now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me\n",
      "  and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man\n",
      "  so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men\n",
      "  and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand\n",
      "and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite\n",
      "  and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem\n",
      "then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces\n",
      "  and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered\n",
      "even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done\n",
      "let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god be on me and on my father s house but not on thy people that they should be plagued\n",
      "  then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite\n",
      "  and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of the lord\n",
      "  and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves\n",
      "now ornan was threshing wheat\n",
      "  and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground\n",
      "  then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people\n",
      " and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i give it all\n",
      "  and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost\n",
      "  so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight\n",
      "  and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering\n",
      "  and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof\n",
      "  at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there\n",
      "  for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon\n",
      "  but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord\n",
      " then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel\n",
      " and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god\n",
      " and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight  also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david\n",
      " and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it\n",
      "so david prepared abundantly before his death\n",
      " then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel\n",
      " and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god  but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight\n",
      " behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days\n",
      "  he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever\n",
      "  now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee\n",
      " only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god\n",
      "  then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed\n",
      "  now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto\n",
      "  moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work\n",
      "  of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number\n",
      "arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee\n",
      "  david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying   is not the lord your god with you\n",
      "and hath he not given you rest on every side\n",
      "for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people\n",
      "  now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord\n",
      "so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son king over israel\n",
      "and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites\n",
      "now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand\n",
      "of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise therewith\n",
      "and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi namely gershon kohath and merari\n",
      "of the gershonites were laadan and shimei\n",
      "the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel three\n",
      "the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three\n",
      "these were the chief of the fathers of laadan\n",

      " and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance\n",
      " and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price\n",
      " and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria by their means\n",
      "and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord and an house for his kingdom\n",
      "and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them\n",
      "and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein even so deal with me\n",
      "behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the lord our god\n",
      "this is an ordinance for ever to israel\n",
      "and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods\n",
      "but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him\n",
      "who am i then that i should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him\n",
      "send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide\n",
      "send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be wonderful great\n",
      " and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil\n",
      " then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee king over them\n",
      "huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the lord and an house for his kingdom\n",
      " and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of huram my father s  the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father\n",
      " now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants  and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem\n",
      " and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred\n",
      " and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work\n",
      "then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite\n",
      "and he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign\n",
      "now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god\n",
      "the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits\n",
      "and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold\n",
      "and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains\n",
      "and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim\n",
      "he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the walls\n",
      "and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents\n",
      "and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold\n",
      "and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold\n",
      " and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with gold\n",
      " and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub\n",
      "and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub\n",
      " the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward\n",
      " and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon\n",
      " also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits\n",
      " and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains\n",
      " and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz\n",
      "moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof\n",
      "also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about\n",
      "and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about\n",
      "two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast\n",
      "it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward\n",
      "and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it received and held three thousand baths\n",
      "he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in\n",
      "and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left\n",
      "he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left\n",
      "and he made an hundred basons of gold\n",
      "furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass\n",
      " and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over against the south\n",
      " and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons\n",
      "and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars\n",
      " he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases  one sea and twelve oxen under it\n",
      " the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass\n",
      " in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah\n",
      " thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out\n",
      " and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set  moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn after the manner before the oracle of pure gold  and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that perfect gold  and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold\n",
      "thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of god\n",
      "then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion\n",
      "wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month\n",
      "and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark\n",
      "and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the levites bring up\n",
      "also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude\n",
      "and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above\n",
      "and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without\n",
      "and there it is unto this day\n",
      " there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt\n",
      " and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets   it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord  so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god\n",
      "then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness\n",
      "but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever\n",
      "and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood\n",
      "and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david saying since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel\n",
      "now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel\n",
      "but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heart notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name\n",
      " the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel\n",
      " and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel\n",
      "and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands  for solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven\n",
      " and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts  thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day\n"

      "and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou exceedest the fame that i heard\n",
      "happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom\n",
      "blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and justice\n",
      "and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon\n",
      " and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious stones\n",
      " and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord and to the king s palace and harps and psalteries for singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah\n",
      "and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king\n",
      "so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants\n",
      " now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold  beside that which chapmen and merchants brought\n",
      "and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon\n",
      " and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target\n",
      " and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield\n",
      "and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon\n",
      " moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold\n",
      " and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the sitting place and two lions standing by the stays  and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps\n",
      "there was not the like made in any kingdom\n",
      " and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon\n",
      " for the king s ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks\n",
      " and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom\n",
      "and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart\n",
      " and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules a rate year by year\n",
      " and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem\n",
      " and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt\n",
      " and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance\n",
      " and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all lands\n",
      " now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat\n",
      " and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years\n",
      " and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come to make him king\n",
      " and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was in egypt whither he fled from the presence of solomon the king heard it that jeroboam returned out of egypt\n",
      " and they sent and called him\n",
      "so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee\n",
      " and he said unto them come again unto me after three days\n",
      "and the people departed\n",
      " and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people\n",
      " and they spake unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever\n",
      " but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before him\n",
      " and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us\n",
      "  and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father s loins\n",
      "  for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions\n",
      " so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day\n",
      "  and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men   and answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions\n",
      "  so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat\n",
      "  and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david\n",
      "and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house\n",
      "so all israel went to their tents\n",
      "  but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them\n",
      "  then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died\n",
      "but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem\n",
      "  and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day\n",
      " and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam\n",
      " but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying  speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying  thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me\n",
      "and they obeyed the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam\n",
      " and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah\n",
      " he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa  and bethzur and shoco and adullam  and gath and mareshah and ziph  and adoraim and lachish and azekah   and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities\n",
      "  and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wine\n",
      " and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side\n",
      "  and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts\n",
      "  for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest s office unto the lord   and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made\n",
      "  and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers\n",
      "  so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon\n",
      "  and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse   which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham\n",
      "  and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith\n",
      "  and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters \n",
      "  and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him king\n",
      " and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance\n",
      "and he desired many wives\n",
      "and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him\n",
      "and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had transgressed against the lord with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopians\n",
      "and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem\n",
      "then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak\n",
      "whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous\n",
      "and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak\n",
      "nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries\n",
      "so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king s house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made\n",
      " instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the king s house\n",
      " and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber\n",
      "and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah things went well\n",
      " so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there\n",
      "and his mother s name was naamah an ammonitess\n",
      " and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord\n",
      " now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies\n",
      "and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually\n",
      " and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah\n",
      " he reigned three years in jerusalem\n",
      "his mother s name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah\n",
      "and there was war between abijah and jeroboam\n",
      " and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valour\n",
      " and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel  ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt\n",
      " yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord\n",
      " and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them\n",
      " and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with your golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods\n",
      " have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands\n",
      "so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods\n",
      "  but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business   and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him\n",
      " and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you\n",
      "o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper\n",
      "  but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them\n",
      "  and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets\n",
      "  then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah\n",
      "  and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand\n",
      "  and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men\n",
      "  thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers\n",
      "  and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephraim with the towns thereof\n",
      "  neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord struck him and he died\n",
      "  but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters\n",
      "  and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo\n",
      " so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead\n",
      "in his days the land was quiet ten years\n",
      " and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god  for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves  and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment\n",
      " also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him\n",
      " and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest\n",
      " therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side\n",
      "so they built and prospered\n",
      " and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour\n",
      " and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah\n",
      "  then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah\n",
      "  and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude\n",
      "o lord thou art our god let no man prevail against thee\n",
      " so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled\n",
      "  and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil\n",
      "  and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in them\n",
      "  they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem\n",
      " and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded  and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you\n",
      " now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law\n",
      " but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them\n",
      " and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries\n",
      " and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity\n",
      " be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded\n",
      " and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord\n",
      " and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him\n",
      "  so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa\n",
      "  and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep\n",
      " and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul   that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman\n",
      "  and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets\n",
      "  and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about\n",
      "  and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook kidron\n",
      "  but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days\n",
      "  and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels\n",
      "  and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa\n",
      " in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah\n",
      " then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the king s house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying  there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me\n",
      " and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali\n",
      " and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease\n",
      " then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was building and he built therewith geba and mizpah\n",
      " and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand\n",
      " were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen\n",
      "yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hand\n",
      " for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him\n",
      "herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars\n",
      "  then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing\n",
      "and asa oppressed some of the people the same time\n",
      "  and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel\n",
      " and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians\n",
      "  and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign\n",
      "  and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him\n",
      " and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel\n",
      " and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken\n",
      " and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim  but sought to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel\n",
      " therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance\n",
      " and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah\n",
      " also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the cities of judah\n",
      " and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and jehoram priests\n",
      " and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people\n",
      "  and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat\n",
      "  also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats\n",
      " and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store\n",
      "  and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem\n",
      "  and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand\n",
      "  and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand\n",
      "  and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour\n",
      "  and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand\n",
      "  and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war\n",
      "  these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah\n",
      " now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with ahab\n",
      " and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria\n",
      "and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead\n",
      " and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead\n",
      "and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war\n",
      " and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day\n",
      " therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear\n",
      "and they said go up for god will deliver it into the king s hand\n",
      " but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him\n",
      " and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla\n",
      "and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so\n",
      " and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla\n",
      " and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them\n",
      "  and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed\n",
      "  and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king\n",
      " and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of their s and speak thou good\n",
      "  and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak\n",
      "  and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear\n",
      "and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand\n",
      "  and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord\n",
      "  then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace\n",
      "  and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil\n",
      "  again he said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left\n",
      "  and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead\n",
      "and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner\n",
      "  then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him\n",
      "and the lord said unto him wherewith\n",
      "  and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets\n",
      "and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so\n",
      "  now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee\n",
      " then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee\n",
      "  and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself\n",
      "  then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son   and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace\n",
      "  and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me\n",
      "and he said hearken all ye people\n",
      "  so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead\n",
      "  and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes\n",
      "so the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle\n",
      "  now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel\n",
      "  and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel\n",
      "therefore they compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him\n",
      "  for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him\n",
      "  and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for i am wounded\n",
      " and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died\n",
      " and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem\n",
      " and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord\n",

      " nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god\n",
      " and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers\n",
      " and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah city by city  and said to the judges take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment\n",
      " wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts\n",
      " moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem\n",
      " and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart\n",

      " it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle\n",
      " then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi\n",
      " and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah\n",
      " and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord\n",
      " and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court  and said o lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven\n",

      "  and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord\n",
      "  and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high\n",
      "  and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper\n",
      "  and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever\n",
      "  and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten\n",
      " for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another\n",

      "  and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much\n",
      "  and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day\n",
      "  then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies\n",

      "  and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel\n",
      "  so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about\n",
      "  and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem\n",

      " now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel\n",
      "  and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly   and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongaber\n",
      "  then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works\n",
      "and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish\n",
      " now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david\n",
      "and jehoram his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel\n",
      " and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn\n",
      " now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel\n",
      " jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem\n",
      " and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord\n",
      " howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever\n",
      " in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king\n",
      " then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariots\n",
      "  so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day\n",
      "the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers\n",
      "  moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled judah thereto\n",
      " and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah   but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father s house which were better than thyself   behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods   and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day\n",
      "  moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians   and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the king s house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons\n",
      "  and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease\n",
      "  and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases\n",
      "and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers\n",
      "  thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired\n",
      "howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings\n",
      " and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest\n",
      "so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned\n",
      " forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem\n",
      "his mother s name also was athaliah the daughter of omri\n",
      " he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly\n",
      " wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction\n",
      " he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram\n",
      " and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria\n",
      "and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick\n",

      " and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them\n",
      " and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in samaria  and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart\n",
      "so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom\n",
      "  but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah\n",
      "  but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the king s sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber\n",
      "so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah  hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not\n",
      " and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land\n",
      "and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him\n",
      "and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem\n",
      "and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god\n",
      "and he said unto them behold the king s son shall reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david\n",
      "this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors and a third part shall be at the king s house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord\n",
      "but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord\n",
      "and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out\n",
      "so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses\n",
      "moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king david s which were in the house of god\n",
      " and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about\n",
      " then they brought out the king s son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king\n",
      "and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king\n",
      "now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord  and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise\n",
      "then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason\n",
      " then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword\n",
      "for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord\n",
      " so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king s house they slew her there\n",
      " and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lord s people\n",
      " then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars\n",
      " also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by david\n",
      " and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in\n",
      " and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the king s house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom\n",
      " and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athaliah with the sword\n",
      " joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem\n",
      "his mother s name also was zibiah of beersheba\n",

      " and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters\n",
      " and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord\n",
      " and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter\n",
      "howbeit the levites hastened it not\n",
      " and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness\n",
      " for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim\n",
      " and at the king s commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord\n",
      " and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness\n",
      "  and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end\n",
      "  now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the king s office by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the king s scribe and the high priest s officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again\n",
      "thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance\n",
      " and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord\n",
      "  so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it\n",
      "  and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver\n",
      "and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada\n",
      "  but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died\n",
      "  and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his house\n",
      "  now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king\n",
      "then the king hearkened unto them\n",
      "  and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass\n",
      "  yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear\n",
      "  and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper\n",
      "because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you\n",
      "  and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord\n",
      "  thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son\n",
      "and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it\n",
      " and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus\n",
      "  for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers\n",
      "so they executed judgment against joash\n",
      "  and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases  his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings\n",
      "  and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess\n",
      "  now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings\n",

      " now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father\n",
      " but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin\n",
      " moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield\n",
      " he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver\n",
      " but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim\n",
      " but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down\n",
      " and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel\n",
      "and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this\n",
      "  then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger\n",
      "  and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand\n",
      " and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces\n",
      "  but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil\n",
      "  now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them\n",
      "  wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand\n",
      "  and it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the king s counsel\n",
      "forbear why shouldest thou be smitten\n",
      "then the prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel\n",
      "  then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face\n",

      "  but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of edom\n",
      "  so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah\n",
      "  and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent\n",
      " and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits\n",

      " and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly\n",
      " moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them\n",
      "  also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry\n",
      "  moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah one of the king s captains\n",
      " the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred\n",
      "  and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy\n",
      "  and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stones\n",
      "  and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal\n",
      "and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong\n",
      "  but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense\n",
      "  and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men   and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god\n",
      "  then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar\n",
      "  and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him\n",
      "  and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the king s house judging the people of the land\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write\n",
      " so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem\n",
      "his mother s name also was jerushah the daughter of zadok\n",
      " and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord\n",
      "and the people did yet corruptly\n",
      " he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall of ophel he built much\n",
      " moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers\n",
      " he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed against them\n",
      "and the children of ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley\n",
      "so much did the children of ammon pay unto him both the second year and the third\n",
      " so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the lord his god\n",
      " now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah\n",
      " he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem\n",
      " and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the lord like david his father  for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim\n",
      " moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel\n",
      " he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree\n",
      " wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus\n",
      "and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter\n",
      " for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers\n",
      " and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the king s son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next to the king\n",
      " and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria\n",
      " but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven\n",
      "  and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god\n",
      "  now hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you\n",
      " then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war   and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel\n",
      "  so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation\n",
      "  and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria\n",
      "  at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him\n",
      "  for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives\n",
      "  the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt there\n",
      "  for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord\n",
      "  and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not\n",
      "  for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of assyria but he helped him not\n",
      "  and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord this is that king ahaz\n",
      " for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me\n",
      "but they were the ruin of him and of all israel\n",
      "  and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem\n",
      "  and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers\n",
      "  now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel\n",
      "  and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem\n",
      "and his mother s name was abijah the daughter of zechariah\n",
      " and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father had done\n",
      " he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them\n",
      " and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the east street  and said unto them hear me ye levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place\n",
      " for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs\n",
      " also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel\n",
      " wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyes\n",
      " for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this\n",
      "  now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us\n",
      "  my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense\n",
      " then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah   and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah   and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel\n",
      "  and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord\n",
      "  and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord\n",
      "and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron\n",
      "  now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end\n",
      "  then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof\n",
      "  moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord\n",
      "  then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the lord\n",
      "  and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah\n",
      "and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord\n",
      "  so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar\n",
      " and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them   and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all israel\n",
      "  and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the king s seer and nathan the prophet for so was the commandment of the lord by his prophets\n",
      "  and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets\n",
      "  and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar\n",
      "and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel\n",
      "  and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished\n",
      "  and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped\n",
      "  moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer\n",
      "and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped\n",
      "  then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord\n",
      "and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings\n",
      "  and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord\n",
      "  and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep\n",
      " but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests\n",
      "  and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering\n",
      "so the service of the house of the lord was set in order\n",
      "  and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenly\n",
      " and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel\n",
      " for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month\n",
      " for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem\n",
      " and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation\n",
      " so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written\n",
      " so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria\n",
      " and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye see\n",
      " now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you\n",
      " for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him\n",
      "  so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them\n",
      "  nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem\n",
      " also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord\n",
      "  and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation\n",
      "  and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron\n",
      "  then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord\n",
      "  and they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites\n",
      "  for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord\n",
      "  for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written\n",
      "but hezekiah prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one   that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary\n",
      "  and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people\n",
      "  and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord\n",
      "  and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the lord god of their fathers\n",
      " and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness\n",
      "  for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves\n",
      "  and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced\n",
      "  so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem\n",
      "  then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heaven\n",
      " now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all\n",
      "then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities\n",
      " and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord\n",
      " he appointed also the king s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord\n",
      " moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord\n",
      " and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly\n",
      " and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps\n",
      " in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month\n",
      " and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel\n",
      " then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps\n",
      "  and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store\n",
      "  then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them  and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next\n",
      "  and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god\n",
      "  and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the oblations of the lord and the most holy things\n",
      "  and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small   beside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses   both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses   and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness   also of the sons of aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites\n",
      "  and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god\n",
      "  and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered\n",
      " after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself\n",
      " and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem  he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him\n",
      " so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water\n",
      " also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance\n",
      " and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying  be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him  with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles\n",
      "and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah\n",
      " after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his power with him  unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying   thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem\n",
      "  doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria\n",
      " hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it\n",
      "  know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands\n",
      "were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand\n",
      "  who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand\n",
      "  now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand\n",
      "  and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah\n",
      "  he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand\n",
      "  then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city\n",
      "  and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man\n",
      "  and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven\n",
      "  and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria\n",
      "so he returned with shame of face to his own land\n",
      "and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword\n",
      "  thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every side\n",
      " and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth\n",
      "  in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign\n",
      "  but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem\n",
      "  notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah\n",
      "  and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant jewels   storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks\n",
      "  moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much\n",
      "  this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david\n",
      "and hezekiah prospered in all his works\n",
      "  howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel\n",
      "  and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death\n",
      "and manasseh his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem  but did that which was evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel\n",
      " for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them\n",
      " also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever\n",
      " and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord\n",
      " and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger\n",
      " and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever  neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses\n",
      " so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel\n",
      "  and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken\n",
      "  wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon\n",
      " and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers   and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom\n",
      "then manasseh knew that the lord he was god\n",
      "  now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah\n",
      "  and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city\n",
      "  and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel\n",
      "  nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel\n",
      "  his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seers\n",
      "  so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead\n",
      "  amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in jerusalem\n",
      "  but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them  and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more\n",
      "  and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house\n",
      "  but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead\n",
      "josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years\n",
      "and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left\n",
      "for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images\n",
      "and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them\n",
      "and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed judah and jerusalem\n",
      "and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about\n",
      "and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem\n",
      "now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god\n",
      "and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem\n",
      " and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house  even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed\n",
      "and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments of musick\n",
      " also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters\n",
      " and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses\n",
      " and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord\n",
      "and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan\n",
      " and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they do it\n",
      " and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen\n",
      " then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath given me a book\n",
      "and shaphan read it before the king\n",
      " and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes\n",
      " and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a servant of the king s saying  go enquire of the lord for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that is written in this book\n",
      " and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college  and they spake to her to that effect\n",
      "and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to me  thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah  because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched\n",
      " and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel concerning the words which thou hast heard  because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord\n",
      " behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same\n",
      "so they brought the king word again\n",
      " then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem\n",
      " and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord\n",
      " and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book\n",
      " and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it\n",
      "and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers\n",
      " and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god\n",
      "and all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers\n",
      " moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month\n",
      " and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord  and said unto the levites that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the lord your god and his people israel  and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son\n",
      " and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the division of the families of the levites\n",
      " so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses\n",
      " and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the king s substance\n",
      " and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen\n",
      " conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen\n",
      "  so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites in their courses according to the king s commandment\n",
      "  and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands and the levites flayed them\n",
      " and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses\n",
      "and so did they with the oxen\n",
      "  and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people\n",
      "  and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron\n",
      "  and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the king s seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them\n",
      "  so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah\n",
      "  and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days\n",
      "  and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem\n",
      "  in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept\n",
      "  after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah went out against him\n",
      "  but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah\n",
      "i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not\n",
      "  nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo\n",
      " and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded\n",
      "  his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers\n",
      "and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah\n",
      "  and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations\n",
      "  now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the lord   and his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah\n",
      " then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his father s stead in jerusalem\n",
      " jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem\n",
      " and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold\n",
      " and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim\n",
      "and necho took jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt\n",
      " jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god\n",
      " against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon\n",
      " nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon\n",
      " now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead\n",
      " jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord\n",
      "  and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem\n",
      "  zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in jerusalem\n",
      " and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord\n",
      "  and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel\n",
      "  moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem\n",
      "  and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place   but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was no remedy\n",
      "  therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand\n",
      "  and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon\n",
      "  and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof\n",
      "  and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia   to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years\n",
      "  now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying  thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah\n",

      "and all the congregation said amen and praised the lord\n",
      "and the people did according to this promise\n",
      " moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor\n",
      " but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not i because of the fear of god\n",
      " yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work\n",
      " moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us\n",
      " now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people\n",
      " think upon me my god for good according to all that i have done for this people\n",
      "now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates  that sanballat and geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of ono\n",
      "but they thought to do me mischief\n",
      "and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave it and come down to you\n",
      "yet they sent unto me four times after this sort and i answered them after the same manner\n",
      "then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand wherein was written it is reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these words\n",
      "and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words\n",
      "come now therefore and let us take counsel together\n",
      "then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart\n",
      "for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done\n",
      "now therefore o god strengthen my hands\n",
      " afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee\n",
      " and i said should such a man as i flee\n",
      "and who is there that being as i am would go into the temple to save his life\n",
      "i will not go in\n",
      "and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had hired him\n",
      " therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me\n",
      " my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear\n",
      " so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul in fifty and two days\n",
      " and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god\n",
      " moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them\n",
      " for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah\n",
      " also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him\n",
      "and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear\n",
      "now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many\n",

      "now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces  that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days\n",
      "and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king s palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble\n",
      "and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another  and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king\n",
      "and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man s pleasure\n",
      "also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus\n",
      " on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king  to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on\n",
      "but the queen vashti refused to come at the king s commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him\n",
      " then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king s manner toward all that knew law and judgment  and the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king s face and which sat the first in the kingdom   what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains\n",
      " and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus\n",
      " for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not\n",
      " likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king s princes which have heard of the deed of the queen\n",
      "thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath\n",
      " if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she\n",
      " and when the king s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great  all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and small\n",
      " and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan  for he sent letters into all the king s provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people\n",
      "after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her\n",
      "then said the king s servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hege the king s chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti\n",
      "and the thing pleased the king and he did so\n",
      "now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away\n",
      "and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle s daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter\n",
      "so it came to pass when the king s commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the king s house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women\n",
      "and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the king s house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women\n",
      " esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it\n",
      " and mordecai walked every day before the court of the women s house to know how esther did and what should become of her\n",
      "now when every maid s turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women   then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king s house\n",
      " in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the king s chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name\n",
      " now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the king s chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed\n",
      "and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her\n",
      " so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign\n",
      " and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti\n",
      " then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther s feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king\n",
      " and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat in the king s gate\n",
      " esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him\n",
      " in those days while mordecai sat in the king s gate two of the king s chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus\n",
      " and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecai s name\n",
      "and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king\n",
      "after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him\n",
      "and all the king s servants that were in the king s gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him\n",
      "but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence\n",
      "then the king s servants which were in the king s gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the king s commandment\n",
      "now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai s matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew\n",
      "and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath\n",
      "and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai\n",
      "in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month adar\n",
      "and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the king s laws therefore it is not for the king s profit to suffer them\n",
      "if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king s treasuries\n",
      " and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy\n",
      " and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee\n",
      "then were the king s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king s lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and sealed with the king s ring\n",
      " and the letters were sent by posts into all the king s provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey\n",
      " the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day\n",
      " the posts went out being hastened by the king s commandment and the decree was given in shushan the palace\n",
      "and the king and haman sat down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed\n",
      "when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry and came even before the king s gate for none might enter into the king s gate clothed with sackcloth\n",
      "and in every province whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes\n",
      "so esther s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her\n",
      "then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it not\n",
      "then called esther for hatach one of the king s chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was\n",
      "so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the king s gate\n",
      "and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the king s treasuries for the jews to destroy them\n",
      "also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people\n",
      "and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai\n",
      " again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai  all the king s servants and the people of the king s provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days\n",
      "and they told to mordecai esther s words\n",
      " then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king s house more than all the jews\n",
      " for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this\n",
      " then esther bade them return mordecai this answer  go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish\n",
      " so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him\n",
      "now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king s house over against the king s house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house\n",
      "and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand\n",
      "so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre\n",
      "then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther\n",
      "and what is thy request\n",
      "it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom\n",
      "and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him\n",
      "then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said\n",
      "so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared\n",
      "and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition\n",
      "and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request\n",
      "even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed\n",
      "then answered esther and said my petition and my request is if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said\n",
      "then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the king s gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai\n",
      " nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife\n",
      " and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king\n",
      "haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king\n",
      " yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king s gate\n",
      " then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet\n",
      "and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made\n",
      "on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king\n",
      "and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the king s chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus\n",
      "and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this\n",
      "then said the king s servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him\n",
      "and the king said who is in the court\n",
      "now haman was come into the outward court of the king s house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him\n",
      "and the king s servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court\n",
      "and the king said let him come in\n",
      "so haman came in\n",
      "and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour\n",
      "now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself\n",
      "and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king s most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour\n",
      " then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the king s gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken\n",
      " then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour\n",
      "and mordecai came again to the king s gate\n",
      "but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered\n",
      " and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him\n",
      "then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him\n",
      " and while they were yet talking with him came the king s chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared\n",
      "so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen\n",
      "and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther\n",
      "and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request\n",
      "and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom\n",
      "then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish\n",
      "but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king s damage\n",
      "then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so\n",
      "and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman\n",
      "then haman was afraid before the king and the queen\n",
      "and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king\n",
      "then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther was\n",
      "then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house\n",
      "as the word went out of king s mouth they covered haman s face\n",
      "and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman\n",
      "then the king said hang him thereon\n",
      " so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai\n",
      "then was the king s wrath pacified\n",
      "on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen\n",
      "and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her\n",
      "and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai\n",
      "and esther set mordecai over the house of haman\n",
      "and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews\n",
      "then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther\n",
      "so esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king s provinces for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people\n",
      "or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred\n",
      "then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews\n",
      "write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the king s name and seal it with the king s ring for the writing which is written in the king s name and sealed with the king s ring may no man reverse\n",
      "then were the king s scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language\n",
      " and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the king s ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries  wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar\n",
      " the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies\n",
      " so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the king s commandment\n",
      "and the decree was given at shushan the palace\n",
      " and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad\n",
      " the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour\n",
      " and in every province and in every city whithersoever the king s commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day\n",
      "and many of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them\n",
      "now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the king s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them  the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people\n",
      "and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear of mordecai fell upon them\n",
      "for mordecai was great in the king s house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater\n",
      "thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them\n",
      "and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men\n",
      "and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha and poratha and adalia and aridatha and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vajezatha  the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand\n",
      " on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king\n",
      "and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the king s provinces\n",
      "now what is thy petition\n",
      "and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further\n",
      "and it shall be done\n",
      " then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day s decree and let haman s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows\n",
      " and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman s ten sons\n",
      " for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand\n",
      " but the other jews that were in the king s provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey  on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladness\n",
      " but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness\n",
      " therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another\n",
      " and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far  to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly  as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor\n",
      "and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them  because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them  but when esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows\n",
      " wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur\n",
      "therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them  the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year  and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed\n",
      " then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim\n",
      " and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth  to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cry\n",

      "  when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up from the king s house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lord s house\n",
      "  then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears\n",
      " then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard\n",
      "  therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you\n",
      "  as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you\n",
      "  but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears\n",
      "  then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god\n",
      "  then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying   micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest\n",
      "  did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death\n",
      "did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them\n",
      "thus might we procure great evil against our souls\n",
      "  and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah\n",
      "  and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt   and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt\n",
      " and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people\n",
      "  nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death\n",
      " in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying  thus saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck  and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah  and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters  i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me\n",
      " and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him\n",
      " and all nations shall serve him and his son and his son s son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him\n",
      " and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand\n",
      " therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon   for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish\n",
      "  but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein\n",
      " i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live\n",
      "  why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon\n",
      "  therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you\n",
      "  for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you\n",
      "  also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lord s house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you\n",
      "  hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste\n",
      "  but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city\n",
      "  which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem   yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem   they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this place\n",
      " and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying  thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon\n",
      " within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lord s house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon  and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon\n",
      " then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord  even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lord s house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place\n",
      " nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people  the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence\n",
      " the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him\n",
      "  then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiah s neck and brake it\n",
      "  and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years\n",
      "and the prophet jeremiah went his way\n",
      " then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying   go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also\n",
      "  then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie\n",
      "  therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord\n",
      "  so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month\n",
      " now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon  after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem   by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon  build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them  take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished\n",

      "  and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them   because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord\n",
      "  hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon   thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes   and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire  because they have committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the lord\n",
      "  thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying   thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying   the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks\n",
      "  now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth which maketh himself a prophet to you\n",
      "  for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them\n",
      "  and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet\n",
      "  then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying   send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie   therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord\n",

      " but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it\n",
      "  and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin\n",
      "  and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence   behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely   and they shall be my people and i will be their god   and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them   and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me\n",
      "  yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them\n",
      "  and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans\n",
      "  men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord\n",
      " moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying  thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name  call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not\n",
      " for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword  they come to fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city\n",
      " behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth\n",
      " and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first\n",
      " and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me\n",
      " and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it\n",
      "  thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast   the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord\n",
      "for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord\n",
      " thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down\n",
      "  in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord\n",
      "  behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah\n",
      "  in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land\n",
      "  in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel   neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually\n",
      "  and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying   thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season   then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers\n",
      "  as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me\n",
      " moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying   considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off\n",
      "thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before them\n",
      "  thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth   then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them\n",
      "the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon\n",
      "yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord\n",
      "for i have pronounced the word saith the lord\n",
      "then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem when the king of babylon s army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah\n",
      "this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother\n",
      " now when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go\n",
      " but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids\n",
      "therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying  thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying  at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear\n",
      " and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name  but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids\n",
      " therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth\n",
      " and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof  the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf  i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth\n",
      " and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylon s army which are gone up from you\n",
      " behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant\n",
      " the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying  go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink\n",
      " then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites  and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door  and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine\n",
      " but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever  neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers\n",
      " thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters  nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed   but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us\n",
      "  but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem\n",
      " then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying   thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words\n",
      "saith the lord\n",
      "  the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their father s commandment notwithstanding i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto me\n",
      "  i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me\n",
      "  because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me   therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered\n",
      "  and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you   therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever\n",
      " and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying  take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day\n",

      "  now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying  take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee\n",
      "  so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylon s princes   even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people\n",
      "  now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying   go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee\n",

      " and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place\n",
      " now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you\n",

      "  likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much\n",
      "  moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah   and said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee\n",
      "but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not\n",
      "  then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in judah perish\n",
      "  but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael\n",
      " now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah\n",

      " and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam\n",
      " and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him\n",
      " but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey\n",
      "so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren\n",
      " now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain\n",
      "  then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the king s daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the ammonites\n",
      "  but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done  then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon\n",
      "  now it came to pass that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad\n",
      "  so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah\n",
      "  but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonites\n",
      "  then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from gibeon   and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt   because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land\n",
      " then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near  and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us   that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do\n",

      "  but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god   saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell   and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there   then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die\n",
      "  so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more\n",
      "  the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day\n",
      "  for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it\n",
      "  and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you\n",
      "  now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn\n",
      " and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words  then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt to sojourn there  but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon\n",

      " wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this day\n",
      " therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave you none to remain  in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth\n",
      " have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem\n",
      "  they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers\n",

      "and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious\n",
      "but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee\n",
      "and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein  and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe\n",
      "moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel\n",
      "so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll\n",
      "and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee\n",
      "then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness\n",
      "and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them\n",
      "for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand\n",
      "surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee\n",
      "but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted\n",
      "behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads\n",
      "as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house\n",
      " moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears\n",
      " and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear\n",
      "then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place\n",
      " i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushing\n",
      " so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was strong upon me\n",
      " then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days\n",
      " and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me\n",
      " when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand\n",
      " yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul\n",
      " again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand\n",
      " nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul\n",
      " and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee\n",
      "then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar and i fell on my face\n",
      " then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house\n",
      " but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them  and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house\n",
      " but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house\n",
      "thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round about\n",
      "moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it\n",
      "this shall be a sign to the house of israel\n",
      "lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity\n",
      "for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel\n",
      "and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i have appointed thee each day for a year\n",
      "therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it\n",
      "and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege\n",
      "take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof\n",
      " and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it\n",
      " thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drink\n",
      "and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight\n",
      " and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them\n",
      " then said i ah lord god\n",
      "behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth\n",
      " then he said unto me lo i have given thee cow s dung for man s dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith\n",
      " moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment  that they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquity\n",
      "and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barber s razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair\n",
      "thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them\n",
      "thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts\n",
      "then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel\n",
      "thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her\n",
      "and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in them\n",
      "therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations\n",
      "and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations\n",
      " therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds\n",
      " wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity\n",
      "a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them\n",
      " thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury in them\n",
      " moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by\n",
      " so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes\n",

      " when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread  so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee\n",
      "i the lord have spoken it\n",
      "and the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places\n",

      "and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations\n",
      " and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them\n",
      " thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel\n",

      " so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord\n",
      "moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land\n",

      "then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber\n",
      "and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy\n",
      "and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plain\n",
      "then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north\n",
      "so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry\n",
      "he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do\n",
      "even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here that i should go far off from my sanctuary\n",
      "but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations\n",
      "and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall\n",
      "then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door\n",
      "and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here\n",
      " so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel pourtrayed upon the wall round about\n",
      " and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up\n",
      "then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery\n",
      "for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the earth\n",
      " he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do\n",
      " then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lord s house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz\n",
      " then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man\n",
      "turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these\n",
      " and he brought me into the inner court of the lord s house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east\n",
      " then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man\n",
      "is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here\n",
      "for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose\n",
      " therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them\n",
      "he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand\n",
      "and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer s inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar\n",
      "and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house\n",
      "and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writer s inkhorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof\n",
      "and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary\n",
      "then they began at the ancient men which were before the house\n",
      "and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth\n",
      "and they went forth and slew in the city\n",
      "and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god\n",
      "wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem\n",
      "then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not\n",
      " and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head\n",
      " and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast commanded me\n",
      " then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne\n",
      " and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go in between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city\n",
      "and he went in in my sight\n",
      " now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court\n",
      " then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lord s glory\n",
      " and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh\n",
      " and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels\n",
      " and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out\n",
      " and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man s hand under their wings\n",
      " and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone\n",
      "  and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel\n",
      "  when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went\n",
      " and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had\n",
      "  as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel\n",
      "  and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle\n",
      "  and the cherubims were lifted up\n",
      "this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar\n",
      "  and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them\n",
      "  when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them\n",
      "  then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims\n",
      "  and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lord s house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above\n",
      "  this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims\n",
      "  every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings\n",
      "  and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward\n",
      " moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lord s house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people\n",
      " then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city  which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the flesh\n",
      " therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man\n",
      " and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind every one of them\n",
      " ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain\n",
      " therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it\n",
      " ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord god\n",
      " and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you\n",
      "  ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord\n",
      "  this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel  and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you\n",
      "  and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died\n",
      "then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god\n",
      "wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel\n",
      "  again the word of the lord came unto me saying   son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given in possession\n",
      "  therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come\n",
      "  therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel\n",
      "  and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence\n",
      "  and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh   that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god\n",
      "  but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god\n",
      "  then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above\n",
      " and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city\n",
      "  afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity\n",

      "and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight\n",
      "and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou\n",
      " say thou unto them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among them\n",

      " moreover the word of the lord came to me saying  son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness  and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein\n",
      " and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord\n",

      " again the word of the lord came to me saying\n",
      " son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off\n",
      " therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god\n",
      " and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of the lord  thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing\n",
      " o israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts\n",
      " ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord\n",

      "  because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter   say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it\n",
      " lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it\n",

      "  thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it   to wit the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god\n",
      "  likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them   and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls\n",
      "will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you\n",

      "  because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life  therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord\n",
      " then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me\n",
      " and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be enquired of at all by them\n",
      " therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols  that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols\n",

      " and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel\n",
      "  and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him   that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord god\n",
      " the word of the lord came again to me saying   son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it   though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god\n",
      "  if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts   though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate\n",
      "  or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it   though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves\n",
      "  or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast   though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness\n",
      "  for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast\n",
      "  yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it\n",
      " and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god\n",
      " and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest\n",

      "she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men\n",
      " then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way  and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion  girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity  and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea\n",

      " and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads\n",
      " then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them\n",
      " yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women\n",
      "and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands\n",
      " for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled\n",

      " again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day\n",
      " and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it  gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones\n",
      " take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein\n",
      " wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it\n",
      "bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it\n",
      " for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust  that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered\n",
      " therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city\n",

      " she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire\n",
      "  in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee\n",
      "  i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god\n",
      "  also the word of the lord came unto me saying   son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down\n",

      " and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people  said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him  no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him\n",
      " i will therefore chastise him and release him\n",
      " for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast \n",
      " and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas  who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison \n",
      " pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them\n",
      " but they cried saying crucify him crucify him\n",
      " and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done\n",
      "i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go\n",
      "and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified\n",
      "and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed\n",
      " and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required\n",
      " and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will\n",
      " and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus\n",
      " and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him\n",
      " but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children\n",
      " for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck\n",
      " then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us\n",
      " for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry\n",
      " and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death\n",
      " and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left\n",
      "then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do\n",
      "and they parted his raiment and cast lots\n",
      " and the people stood beholding\n",
      "and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god\n",
      " and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar  and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself\n",
      " and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews\n",
      " and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us\n",
      " but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation\n",
      " and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss\n",
      " and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom\n",
      " and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise\n",
      " and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour\n",
      "and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst\n",
      " and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost\n",
      " now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man\n",
      " and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned\n",
      " and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things\n",
      " and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just  the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them  he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god\n",
      " this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus\n",
      " and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid\n",
      " and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on\n",
      " and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid\n",
      "and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment\n",
      " now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them\n",
      " and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre\n",
      " and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus\n",
      " and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments  and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead\n",
      " he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee  saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again\n",
      " and they remembered his words  and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest\n",
      "  it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles\n",
      "  and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not\n",
      " then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass\n",
      "  and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs\n",
      "  and they talked together of all these things which had happened\n",
      "  and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them\n",
      "  but their eyes were holden that they should not know him\n",
      "  and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad\n",
      "  and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days\n",
      "  and he said unto them what things\n",
      "and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people   and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him\n",
      "  but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done\n",
      "  yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre  and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive\n",
      "  and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not\n",
      "  then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken   ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory\n",
      "  and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself\n",
      "  and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further\n",
      "  but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent\n",
      "and he went in to tarry with them\n",
      "  and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them\n",
      "  and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight\n",
      "  and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures\n",
      "  and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them  saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon\n",
      "  and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread\n",
      "  and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you\n",
      "  but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit\n",
      "  and he said unto them why are ye troubled\n",
      "and why do thoughts arise in your hearts\n",
      "  behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet\n",
      "  and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat\n",
      "  and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb\n",
      "  and he took it and did eat before them\n",
      "  and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me\n",
      " then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures   and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day   and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem\n",
      "  and ye are witnesses of these things\n",
      "  and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high\n",
      "  and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them\n",
      "  and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven\n",
      "  and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy   and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god\n",

      "the gospel according to saint john\n",
      "in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god\n",

      "all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made\n",
      "in him was life and the life was the light of men\n",
      "and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not\n",
      "there was a man sent from god whose name was john\n",
      "the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe\n",
      "he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light\n",
      "that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world\n",
      " he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not\n",
      " he came unto his own and his own received him not\n",
      "but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name  which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god\n",

      " no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him\n",

      " the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world\n",
      " this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me\n",
      " and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water\n",
      " and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him\n",
      " and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost\n",

      "they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master  where dwellest thou\n",
      " he saith unto them come and see\n",
      "they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour\n",
      " one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter s brother\n",

      " nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me\n",
      "jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee\n",
      " nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou\n",
      "thou shalt see greater things than these\n",
      " and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man\n",
      "and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage\n",
      "and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine\n",
      "jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee\n",
      "mine hour is not yet come\n",
      "his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it\n",
      "and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece\n",
      "jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water\n",
      "and they filled them up to the brim\n",
      "and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast\n",
      "and they bare it\n",
      "when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew  the governor of the feast called the bridegroom  and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now\n",
      " this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him\n",
      "after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days\n",
      " and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem\n",
      " and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting  and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables  and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father s house an house of merchandise\n",
      " and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up\n",
      " then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up\n",
      " then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days\n",
      " but he spake of the temple of his body\n",
      " when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said\n",
      "now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did\n",
      " but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men  and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man\n",
      "there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him\n",
      "jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god\n",
      "nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old\n",
      "can he enter the second time into his mother s womb and be born\n",

      " verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness\n",
      "if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things\n",
      " and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven\n",
      " and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life\n",
      " for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life\n",
      " for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved\n",
      " he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god\n",
      " and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil\n",
      " for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved\n",
      " but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god\n",
      " after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized\n",
      "and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized\n",
      " for john was not yet cast into prison\n",
      " then there arose a question between some of john s disciples and the jews about purifying\n",
      " and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him\n",
      " john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven\n",
      " ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him\n",
      " he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom s voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled\n",

      " he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all\n",
      " and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony\n",
      " he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true\n",
      "for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him\n",
      " the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand\n",
      " he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him\n",
      "when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples  he left judaea and departed again into galilee\n",
      "and he must needs go through samaria\n",
      "then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph\n",
      "now jacob s well was there\n",
      "jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour\n",
      "there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink\n",
      "for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat \n",
      "then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria\n",
      "for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water\n",
      " the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water\n",
      "art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again  but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\n",
      " the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw\n",
      " jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither\n",
      " the woman answered and said i have no husband\n",
      "jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband  for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly\n",
      " the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet\n",
      " our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship\n",
      " jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father\n",
      " ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews\n",
      "but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him\n",
      " god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth\n",
      " the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things\n",
      " jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he\n",
      " and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou\n",
      "or why talkest thou with her\n",
      " the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men  come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ\n",
      " then they went out of the city and came unto him\n",
      " in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat\n",
      " but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of\n",
      " therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat\n",
      "jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work\n",

      " and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth\n",
      " i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours\n",
      " and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did\n",
      " so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days\n",
      " and many more believed because of his own word  and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world\n",
      " now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee\n",
      " for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country\n",
      "then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast\n",
      " so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine\n",
      "and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum\n",
      " when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death\n",
      " then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe\n",
      " the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die\n",
      " jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth\n",
      "and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way\n",
      " and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth\n",
      " then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend\n",
      "and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him\n",
      " so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house\n",
      " this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee\n",
      "after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem\n",
      "now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches\n",
      "in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water\n",
      "for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had\n",
      "and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years\n",
      "when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole\n",
      "the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me\n",
      "jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk\n",
      "and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath\n",
      " the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed\n",
      " he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk\n",
      "then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk\n",
      " and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place\n",
      " afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee\n",
      " the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole\n",
      " and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day\n",
      " but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work\n",
      " therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god\n",
      " then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise\n",
      " for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel\n",
      " for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will\n",
      " for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father\n",
      "he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him\n",
      " verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life\n",
      " verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live\n",
      " for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself  and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man\n",
      " marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice  and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation\n",
      " i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me\n",
      " if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true\n",
      " there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true\n",
      " ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth\n",
      "but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved\n",
      " he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light\n",
      " but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me\n",
      " and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me\n",
      "ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape\n",
      " and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not\n",
      " search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me\n",
      " and ye will not come to me that ye might have life\n",
      " i receive not honour from men\n",
      " but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you\n",
      " i am come in my father s name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive\n",
      " how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only\n",
      "do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust\n",
      " for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me\n",
      " but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words\n",
      "after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias\n",
      "and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased\n",
      "and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples\n",
      "and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh\n",
      "when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat\n",
      "and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do\n",
      "philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little\n",
      "one of his disciples andrew simon peter s brother saith unto him there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many\n",
      " and jesus said make the men sit down\n",
      "now there was much grass in the place\n",
      "so the men sat down in number about five thousand\n",
      " and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would\n",
      "when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost\n",
      " therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten\n",
      " then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world\n",
      " when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone\n",
      " and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea  and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum\n",
      "and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them\n",
      " and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew\n",
      " so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid\n",
      " but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid\n",
      " then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went\n",
      " the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks   when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus\n",
      " and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither\n",
      " jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled\n",
      " labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed\n",
      " then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent\n",
      " they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee\n",
      "what dost thou work\n",
      " our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat\n",
      " then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven\n",
      " for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world\n",
      "then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread\n",
      " and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst\n",
      " but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not\n",
      " all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out\n",
      " for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me\n",
      " and this is the father s will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day\n",
      " and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day\n",
      " the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven\n",
      " and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know\n",
      "how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven\n",
      " jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves\n",
      " no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day\n",

      " i am that bread of life\n",
      " your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead\n",
      " this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die\n",
      " i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world\n",
      " the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat\n",
      " then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you\n",
      " whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day\n",

      "he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him\n",
      " as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me\n",
      " this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever\n",
      " these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum\n",
      " many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it\n",
      " when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you\n",
      " what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before\n",
      " it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life\n",
      " but there are some of you that believe not\n",
      "for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him\n",
      " and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father\n",
      " from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him\n",

      " he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve\n",
      "after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him\n",
      "now the jew s feast of tabernacles was at hand\n",
      "his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest\n",

      " he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight\n",
      "then said they unto him where is he\n",
      "he said i know not\n",

      "and there was a division among them\n",
      " they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes\n",
      "he said he is a prophet\n",
      " but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight\n",

      "how then doth he now see\n",
      " his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind  but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself\n",
      " these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue\n",
      "therefore said his parents he is of age ask him\n",
      " then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner\n",
      " he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see\n",
      " then said they to him again what did he to thee\n",
      "how opened he thine eyes\n",

      " and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also\n",
      " jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth\n",
      " verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber\n",
      " but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep\n",

      "  and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation   and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad\n",
      "  then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death\n",
      "  jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples\n",
      "  and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves\n",
      " then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast\n",
      "  now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him\n",
      "then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead\n",
      "there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him\n",
      "then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment\n",
      "then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simon s son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor\n",
      "this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein\n",
      "then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this\n",
      "for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always\n",
      "much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead\n",
      " but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death  because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus\n",
      "on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem  took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord\n",
      " and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written  fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an ass s colt\n",
      " these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him\n",
      " the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record\n",
      " for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle\n",
      " the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing\n",
      "behold the world is gone after him\n",
      " and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast  the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus\n",
      " philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus\n",
      "and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified\n",
      " verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit\n",
      " he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal\n",
      " if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour\n",
      " now is my soul troubled and what shall i say\n",
      "father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour\n",
      " father glorify thy name\n",
      "then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again\n",
      " the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him\n",
      " jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes\n",
      " now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out\n",
      " and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me\n",
      " this he said signifying what death he should die\n",
      "the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up\n",
      "who is this son of man\n",
      " then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you\n",
      "walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth\n",
      " while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light\n",
      "these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them\n",
      " but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him  that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report\n",
      "and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed\n",
      " therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again  he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them\n",
      " these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him\n",
      " nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue  for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god\n",
      " jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me\n",
      "and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me\n",
      " i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness\n",
      " and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world\n",
      " he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day\n",
      " for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak\n",
      " and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak\n",
      " now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end\n",
      " and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon s son to betray him  jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god  he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself\n",
      " after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded\n",
      " then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet\n",
      " jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter\n",
      " peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet\n",
      "jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me\n",
      " simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head\n",
      "  jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all\n",
      "  for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean\n",
      " so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you\n",
      "  ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am\n",
      "  if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet\n",
      "  for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you\n",
      "  verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him\n",
      "  if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them\n",
      "  i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me\n",
      "  now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he\n",
      "  verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me\n",
      "  when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me\n",
      "  then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake\n",
      " now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved\n",
      "  simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake\n",
      "  he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it\n",
      "  jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it\n",
      "and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon\n",
      "  and after the sop satan entered into him\n",
      "then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly\n",
      "  now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him\n",
      "  for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor\n",
      "  he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night\n",
      "  therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him\n",
      "  if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him\n",
      "  little children yet a little while i am with you\n",
      "ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you\n",

      "  by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another\n",

      "jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards\n",
      "  peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now\n",
      "i will lay down my life for thy sake\n",
      "  jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake\n",

      "then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter\n",
      "  then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this man s disciples\n",
      "he saith i am not\n",
      "  and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself\n",
      "  the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine\n",
      "  jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing\n",
      "  why askest thou me\n",
      "ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so\n",
      " jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me\n",
      "  now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest\n",
      "  and simon peter stood and warmed himself\n",
      "they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples\n",
      "he denied it and said i am not\n",
      "  one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him\n",
      "  peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew\n",
      "  then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover\n",
      "  pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man\n",
      "  they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee\n",
      "  then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law\n",
      "the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death   that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die\n",
      "  then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews\n",
      " jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me\n",
      "  pilate answered am i a jew\n",
      "thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done\n",
      "  jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence\n",
      "  pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then\n",
      "jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king\n",
      "to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth\n",
      "every one that is of the truth heareth my voice\n",
      "  pilate saith unto him what is truth\n",
      "and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all\n",
      "  but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews\n",
      "  then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas\n",
      "now barabbas was a robber\n",
      " then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him\n",
      " and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe  and said hail king of the jews\n",
      "and they smote him with their hands\n",
      " pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him\n",
      " then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe\n",
      "and pilate saith unto them behold the man\n",
      " when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him\n",
      "pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him\n",
      " the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god\n",
      " when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid  and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou\n",
      "but jesus gave him no answer\n",
      "  then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me\n",
      "knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee\n",
      "  jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin\n",
      " and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesar s friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar\n",
      "  when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha\n",
      "  and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king\n",
      "  but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him\n",
      "pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king\n",
      "the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar\n",
      "  then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified\n",
      "and they took jesus and led him away\n",
      "  and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha   where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst\n",
      "  and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross\n",
      "and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews\n",
      "  this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin\n",
      "  then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews\n",
      "  pilate answered what i have written i have written\n",
      " then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout\n",
      "  they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots\n",
      "these things therefore the soldiers did\n",
      "  now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mother s sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene\n",
      "  when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son\n",
      "  then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother\n",
      "and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home\n",
      "  after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst\n",
      "  now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth\n",
      "  when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost\n",
      "  the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day  besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away\n",
      "  then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him\n",
      "  but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs  but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water\n",
      "  and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe\n",
      "  for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken\n",
      "  and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced\n",
      "  and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave\n",
      "he came therefore and took the body of jesus\n",
      "  and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight\n",
      "  then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury\n",
      "  now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid\n",
      "  there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand\n",
      " the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre\n",
      " then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him\n",
      " peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre\n",
      " so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre\n",
      " and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in\n",
      " then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie  and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself\n",
      " then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed\n",
      " for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead\n",
      "  then the disciples went away again unto their own home\n",
      "  but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre  and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain\n",
      "  and they say unto her woman why weepest thou\n",
      "she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him\n",
      "  and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus\n",
      "  jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou\n",
      "whom seekest thou\n",
      "she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away\n",
      "  jesus saith unto her mary\n",
      "she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master\n",
      "  jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god\n",
      "  mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her\n",
      "  then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you\n",
      "  and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side\n",
      "then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord\n",
      "  then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you\n",
      "  and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost  whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained\n",
      "  but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came\n",
      "  the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord\n",
      "but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe\n",
      "  and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you\n",
      "  then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing\n",
      "  and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god\n",
      "  jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed\n",
      "  and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book   but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name\n",
      " after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself\n",
      " there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples\n",
      " simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing\n",
      "they say unto him we also go with thee\n",
      "they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing\n",
      " but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus\n",
      " then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat\n",
      "they answered him no\n",
      " and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find\n",
      "they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes\n",
      " therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord\n",
      "now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fisher s coat unto him for he was naked  and did cast himself into the sea\n",
      " and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits  dragging the net with fishes\n",
      " as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread\n",
      "  jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught\n",
      "  simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken\n",
      " jesus saith unto them come and dine\n",
      "and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou\n",
      "knowing that it was the lord\n",
      "  jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise\n",
      "  this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead\n",
      "  so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these\n",
      "he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee\n",

      "  he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me\n",
      "he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee\n",
      "he saith unto him feed my sheep\n",
      "  he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me\n",
      "peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me\n",
      "and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee\n",
      "jesus saith unto him feed my sheep\n",
      "  verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not\n",
      "  this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god\n",
      "and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me\n",
      "  then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee\n",
      "  peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do\n",
      "  jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee\n",
      "follow thou me\n",
      " then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee\n",
      "  this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true\n",

      "the acts of the apostles\n",
      "the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me\n",
      "for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence\n",
      "when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel\n",
      "and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power\n",
      "but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth\n",
      "and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight\n",
      " and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel  which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven\n",
      "this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven\n",
      "then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath day s journey\n",
      " and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james\n",
      " these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren\n",
      " and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty   men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus\n",
      " for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry\n",
      " now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out\n",
      " and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood\n",
      " for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take\n",
      " wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us  beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection\n",
      "and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed justus and matthias\n",
      " and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place\n",
      " and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles\n",
      "and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place\n",
      "and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting\n",
      "and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them\n",
      "and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance\n",
      "and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven\n",
      "now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language\n",
      "and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans\n",
      "and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born\n",
      "parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia  phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes  cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god\n",
      "and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this\n",
      " others mocking said these men are full of new wine\n",
      " but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words  for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day\n",
      " but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel  and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams  and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy  and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke  the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come  and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved\n",
      " ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain  whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it\n",
      " for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved  therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope  because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption\n",
      " thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance\n",
      " men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day\n",
      " therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne  he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption\n",
      " this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses\n",
      " therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear\n",
      "for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand  until i make thy foes thy footstool\n",
      " therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ\n",
      " now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do\n",
      " then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost\n",
      " for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call\n",
      " and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation\n",
      " then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls\n",
      " and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers\n",
      " and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles\n",
      " and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need\n",
      " and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart  praising god and having favour with all the people\n",
      "and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved\n",
      "now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour\n",
      "and a certain man lame from his mother s womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms\n",
      "and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us\n",
      "and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them\n",
      "then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk\n",
      "and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength\n",
      "and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god\n",
      "and all the people saw him walking and praising god  and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him\n",
      " and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomon s greatly wondering\n",
      "and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this\n",
      "or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk\n",
      " the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go\n",
      " but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you  and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses\n",
      " and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all\n",
      " and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers\n",
      " but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled\n",
      " repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord\n",
      " and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you  whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began\n",
      " for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you\n",
      "and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people\n",
      " yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days\n",
      " ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed\n",
      " unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities\n",
      "and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead\n",
      "and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide\n",
      "howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand\n",
      "and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem\n",
      "and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this\n",
      "then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole  be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole\n",
      " this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner\n",
      "neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved\n",
      " now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus\n",
      " and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it\n",
      " but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves  saying what shall we do to these men\n",
      "for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it\n",
      " but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name\n",
      " and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus\n",
      " but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye\n",
      " for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard\n",
      " so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done\n",
      " for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed\n",
      "and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them\n",
      " and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is  who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things\n",
      " the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ\n",
      " for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together  for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done\n",
      " and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word  by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus\n",
      " and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness\n",
      " and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common\n",
      " and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all\n",
      "neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold  and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need\n",
      " and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation  a levite and of the country of cyprus  having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet\n",
      "but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet\n",
      "but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land\n",
      "whiles it remained was it not thine own\n",
      "and after it was sold was it not in thine own power\n",
      "why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart\n",
      "thou hast not lied unto men but unto god\n",
      "and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things\n",
      "and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him\n",
      "and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in\n",
      "and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much\n",
      "and she said yea for so much\n",
      "then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord\n",
      "behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out\n",
      " then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband\n",
      " and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things\n",
      "and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomon s porch\n",
      " and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them\n",
      " and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women \n",
      " insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them\n",
      " there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one\n",
      " then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees  and were filled with indignation  and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison\n",
      " but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said  go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life\n",
      " and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught\n",
      "but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought\n",
      " but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within\n",
      " now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow\n",
      " then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people\n",
      " then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned\n",
      " and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them  saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name\n",
      "and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man s blood upon us\n",
      " then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men\n",
      " the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree\n",
      " him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins\n",
      " and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him\n",
      " when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them\n",
      "then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space  and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men\n",
      " for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought\n",
      " after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed\n",
      " and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought  but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god\n",
      " and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go\n",
      " and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name\n",
      " and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ\n",
      "and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration\n",
      "then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables\n",
      "wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business\n",
      "but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word\n",
      "and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them\n",
      "and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith\n",
      "and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people\n",
      "then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen\n",
      " and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake\n",
      " then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god\n",
      "and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council  and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law  for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us\n",
      " and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel\n",
      "then said the high priest are these things so\n",
      "and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee\n",
      "then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell\n",
      "and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child\n",
      "and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years\n",
      "and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place\n",
      "and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs\n",
      "and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him  and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house\n",
      " now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance\n",
      "but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first\n",
      " and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and joseph s kindred was made known unto pharaoh\n",
      " then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls\n",
      " so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers  and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem\n",
      " but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt  till another king arose which knew not joseph\n",
      " the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live\n",
      " in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father s house three months  and when he was cast out pharaoh s daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son\n",
      " and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds\n",
      "and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel\n",
      " and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian  for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not\n",
      " and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another\n",
      " but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us\n",
      " wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday\n",
      " then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons\n",
      " and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush\n",
      " when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him  saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob\n",
      "then moses trembled and durst not behold\n",
      " then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground\n",
      "i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them\n",
      "and now come i will send thee into egypt\n",
      " this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge\n",
      "the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush\n",
      " he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years\n",
      " this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear\n",
      " this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us  to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt  saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him\n",
      " and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands\n",
      " then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness\n",
      " yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon\n",
      " our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen\n",
      "which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david  who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob\n",
      " but solomon built him an house\n",
      " howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet  heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me\n",

      " when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth\n",
      " but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god\n",
      " then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord  and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man s feet whose name was saul\n",
      " and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit\n",
      " and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge\n",

      "as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison\n",
      "therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word\n",

      "and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did\n",
      "for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed\n",
      "and there was great joy in that city\n",
      "but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one  to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god\n",
      " and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries\n",
      "but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women\n",
      " then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done\n",
      " now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john  who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost  for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus \n",
      " then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost\n",
      " and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money  saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost\n",
      " but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money\n",
      " thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god\n",
      " repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee\n",
      "for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity\n",
      " then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me\n",
      " and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans\n",
      " and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert\n",
      " and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship  was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet\n",
      " then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot\n",
      " and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest\n",
      " and he said how can i except some man should guide me\n",

      "and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this\n",
      "of himself or of some other man\n",
      " then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus\n",
      " and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized\n",
      " and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest\n",
      "and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god\n",
      " and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him\n",
      " and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing\n",
      " but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea\n",
      "and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem\n",
      "and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me\n",
      "and he said who art thou lord\n",
      "and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks\n",

      " and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight\n",
      " then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem  and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name\n",
      " but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel  for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name s sake\n",
      " and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost\n",
      " and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized\n",
      " and when he had received meat he was strengthened\n",
      "then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus\n",
      " and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god\n",
      " but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests\n",
      " but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ\n",

      " and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them  they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about  and there they preached the gospel\n",
      " and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mother s womb who never had walked  the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed   said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet\n",

      "  then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people\n",

      "  nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness\n",

      "  forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment   it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul   men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ\n",
      "  we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth\n",
      "  for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things   that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well\n",
      "fare ye well\n",
      "  so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle   which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation\n",
      "  and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them\n",
      "  and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles\n",
      " notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still\n",
      "  paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also\n",
      "  and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do\n",
      "  and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark\n",
      "  but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work\n",
      "  and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus   and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god\n",
      "  and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches\n",
      " then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek  which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium\n",
      " him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek\n",
      " and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem\n",
      " and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily\n",
      " now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia  after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not\n",
      " and they passing by mysia came down to troas\n",
      " and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us\n",
      "  and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them\n",
      "  therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis  and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days\n",
      "  and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither\n",
      "  and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul\n",
      "  and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there\n",
      "and she constrained us\n",
      "  and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying   the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation\n",
      "  and this did she many days\n",
      "but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her\n",
      "and he came out the same hour\n",
      "  and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers   and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city   and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans\n",
      "  and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them\n",
      " and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely   who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks\n",
      "  and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them\n",
      "  and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every one s bands were loosed\n",
      "  and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled\n",
      "  but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here\n",
      "  then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas   and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved\n",
      "  and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house\n",
      "  and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house\n",
      "  and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway\n",
      " and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house\n",
      "  and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go\n",
      "  and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace\n",
      "  but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily\n",
      "nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out\n",
      "  and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans\n",
      "  and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city\n",
      "  and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed\n",
      " now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews  and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures  opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ\n",
      " and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few\n",
      " but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people\n",
      " and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also  whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus\n",
      " and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things\n",
      " and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go\n",
      "  and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews\n",
      "  these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so\n",
      " therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few\n",
      "  but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people\n",
      "  and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still\n",
      "  and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed\n",
      "  now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry\n",
      "  therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him\n",
      "  then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him\n",
      "and some said what will this babbler say\n",
      "other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection\n",
      "  and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is\n",
      "  for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean\n",
      "  for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing \n",
      "  then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious\n",
      " for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god\n",
      "whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you\n",
      "  god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands   neither is worshipped with men s hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things   and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation   that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us   for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring\n",
      "  forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man s device\n",
      "  and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent   because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead\n",
      "  and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter\n",
      "  so paul departed from among them\n",
      " howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them\n",
      " after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth  and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome  and came unto them\n",
      " and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers\n",
      " and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks\n",
      " and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ\n",
      " and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles\n",
      " and he departed thence and entered into a certain man s house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue\n",
      " and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized\n",
      " then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace   for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city\n",
      "  and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them\n",
      " and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat   saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law\n",
      "  and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you   but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters\n",
      "  and he drave them from the judgment seat\n",
      "  then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat\n",
      "and gallio cared for none of those things\n",
      "  and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow\n",
      "  and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews\n",
      "  when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not   but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will\n",
      "and he sailed from ephesus\n",
      "  and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch\n",
      " and after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples\n",
      "  and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus\n",
      "  this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john\n",
      "  and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly\n",
      "  and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace   for he mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ\n",
      " and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples  he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed\n",
      "and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost\n",
      " and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized\n",
      "and they said unto john s baptism\n",
      " then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus\n",
      " when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus\n",
      " and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied\n",
      " and all the men were about twelve\n",
      " and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god\n",
      " but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus\n",
      "  and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks\n",
      "  and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul  so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them\n",
      "  then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth\n",
      "  and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so\n",
      "  and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye\n",
      "  and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded\n",
      "  and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified\n",
      "  and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds\n",
      "  many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver\n",
      "  so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed\n",
      "  after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome\n",
      "  so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season\n",
      " and the same time there arose no small stir about that way\n",
      "  for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen   whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth\n",
      "  moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands   so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth\n",
      "  and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians\n",
      "  and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia paul s companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre\n",
      "  and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not\n",
      "  and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre\n",
      "  some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together\n",
      "  and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward\n",
      "and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people\n",
      " but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians\n",
      "  and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter\n",
      "  seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly\n",
      "  for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess\n",
      "  wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another\n",
      "  but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly\n",
      "  for we are in danger to be called in question for this day s uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly\n",
      " and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia\n",
      " and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece  and there abode three months\n",
      "and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia\n",
      " and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus\n",
      " these going before tarried for us at troas\n",
      " and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days\n",
      " and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight\n",
      " and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together\n",
      " and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead\n",
      "  and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him\n",
      "  when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed\n",
      " and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted\n",
      "  and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot\n",
      "  and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene\n",
      "  and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus\n",
      "  for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost\n",
      "  and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church\n",
      "  and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons   serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews   and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house   testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ\n",
      "  and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there  save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me\n",
      "  but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god\n",
      "  and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more\n",
      "  wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men\n",
      "  for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god\n",
      "  take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood\n",
      "  for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock\n",
      "  also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them\n",
      "  therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears\n",
      "  and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified\n",
      "  i have coveted no man s silver or gold or apparel\n",
      " yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me\n",
      "  i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all\n",
      "  and they all wept sore and fell on paul s neck and kissed him   sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more\n",
      "and they accompanied him unto the ship\n",
      " and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara  and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth\n",
      " now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden\n",
      " and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem\n",
      " and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed\n",
      " and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home again\n",
      " and when we had finished our course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day\n",
      " and the next day we that were of paul s company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him\n",
      " and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy\n",
      "  and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus\n",
      "  and when he was come unto us he took paul s girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles\n",
      " and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem\n",
      "  then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart\n",
      "for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus\n",
      "  and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done\n",
      "  and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem\n",
      "  there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge\n",
      "  and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly\n",
      "  and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present\n",
      "  and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry\n",
      "  and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law   and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs\n",
      "  what is it therefore\n",
      "the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come\n",
      " do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them   them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law\n",
      "  as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication\n",
      "  then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them\n",
      "  and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him   crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place\n",
      "  for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple \n",
      "  and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut\n",
      "  and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar\n",
      "  who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul\n",
      "  then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done\n",
      " and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle\n",

      "  for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him\n",

      "who said canst thou speak greek\n",
      "  art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers\n",
      "  but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people\n",
      "  and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people\n",
      "and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying  men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto you\n",
      " and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith   i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day\n",
      " and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women\n",
      " as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished\n",
      " and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me\n",
      " and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me\n",
      " and i answered who art thou lord\n",

      "  and now why tarriest thou\n",
      "arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord\n",
      "  and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance   and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me\n",
      "  and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee   and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him\n",

      " and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air   the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him\n",
      "  and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned\n",
      "  when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman\n",
      "  then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman\n",
      "he said yea\n",
      "  and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom\n",
      "and paul said but i was free born\n",
      "  then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him\n",
      "  on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them\n",
      "and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day\n",
      "and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth\n",

      "then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people\n",
      "but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question\n",
      "and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided\n",
      "for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both\n",
      "and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god\n",
      " and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle\n",
      " and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome\n",
      "and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul\n",
      " and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy\n",
      " and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul\n",
      " now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him\n",
      " and when paul s sister s son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul\n",
      " then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him\n",
      " so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee\n",
      " then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me\n",
      " and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly\n",
      " but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee\n",
      " so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me\n",
      "and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night  and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor\n",
      " and he wrote a letter after this manner  claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting\n",
      " this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman\n",
      " and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council  whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds\n",
      " and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him\n",
      "farewell\n",
      " then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris\n",
      " on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle  who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him\n",
      "and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was\n",
      "and when he understood that he was of cilicia  i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come\n",
      "and he commanded him to be kept in herod s judgment hall\n",
      " and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul\n",
      " and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence  we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness\n",
      " notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words\n",
      " for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes  who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law\n",
      " but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands  commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him\n",
      " and the jews also assented saying that these things were so\n",
      "  then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself   because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship\n",
      " and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city   neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me\n",
      "  but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets   and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust\n",
      "  and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void to offence toward god and toward men\n",
      "  now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings\n",
      "  whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult\n",
      "  who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me\n",
      "  or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council   except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day\n",
      "  and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter\n",
      " and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him\n",
      "  and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ\n",
      "  and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee\n",
      "  he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him\n",
      "  but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound\n",
      " now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem\n",
      " then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him  and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him\n",
      " but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither\n",
      " let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him\n",
      " and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought\n",
      " and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove\n",
      " while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all\n",
      " but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me\n",
      "  then said paul i stand at caesar s judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest\n",
      "  for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them\n",
      "i appeal unto caesar\n",
      " then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar\n",
      "unto caesar shalt thou go\n",
      "  and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus\n",
      "  and when they had been there many days festus declared paul s cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix   about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him\n",
      "  to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him\n",
      "  therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth\n",
      "  against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed   but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive\n",
      "  and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters\n",
      "  but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar\n",
      "  then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself\n",
      "to morrow said he thou shalt hear him\n",
      " and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth\n",
      "  and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer\n",
      "  but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him\n",
      "  of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord\n",
      "wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write\n",
      "  for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him\n",
      " then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself\n",
      "then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself  i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews  especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently\n",
      " my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews  which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee\n",
      " and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers  unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come\n",
      "for which hope s sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews\n",
      " why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead\n",
      " i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth\n",
      "  which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them\n",
      "  and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities\n",
      " whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests   at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me\n",
      "  and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me\n",
      "it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks\n",
      "  and i said who art thou lord\n",
      "and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest\n",
      "  but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee   delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee   to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me\n",
      "  whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision   but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance\n",
      "  for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me\n",
      "  having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come  that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles\n",
      "  and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad\n",
      "  but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness\n",
      "  for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner\n",
      "  king agrippa believest thou the prophets\n",
      "i know that thou believest\n",
      "  then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian\n",
      "  and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them   and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds\n",
      "  then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar\n",
      " and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band\n",
      " and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us\n",
      " and the next day we touched at sidon\n",
      "and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself\n",
      " and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary\n",
      " and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia\n",
      " and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein\n",
      " and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone  and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea\n",
      " now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them   and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives\n",
      "  nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul\n",
      " and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west\n",
      "  and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete\n",
      "  but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon\n",
      "  and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive\n",
      "  and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat   which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven\n",
      "  and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship   and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship\n",
      "  and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away\n",
      "  but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss\n",
      "  and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man s life among you but of the ship\n",
      " for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve   saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee\n",
      "  wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me\n",
      "  howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island\n",
      "  but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country   and sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms\n",
      "  then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day\n",
      "  and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship   paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved\n",
      "  then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off\n",
      "  and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing\n",
      " wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you\n",
      "  and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat\n",
      "  then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat\n",
      "  and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls\n",
      "  and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea\n",
      "  and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship\n",
      "  and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore\n",
      "  and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves\n",
      "  and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape\n",
      "  but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land   and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship\n",
      "and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land\n",
      " and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita\n",
      " and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold\n",
      " and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand\n",
      " and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live\n",
      " and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm\n",
      " howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god\n",
      " in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously\n",
      " and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him\n",
      " so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed   who also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary\n",
      "  and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux\n",
      " and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days\n",
      "  and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli   where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome\n",
      "  and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage\n",
      "  and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him\n",
      "  and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans\n",
      "  who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me\n",
      "  but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of\n",
      "  for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain\n",
      "  and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee\n",
      "  but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against\n",
      " and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening\n",
      "  and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not\n",
      "  and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers   saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive   for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them\n",
      "  be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it\n",
      "  and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves\n",
      "  and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him   preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him\n",
      "the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans\n",
      "paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures  concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ\n",
      "first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world\n",

      " for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith\n",
      " for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness  because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them\n",
      " for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse  because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened\n",
      " professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things\n",
      " wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves  who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever\n",
      "amen\n",
      " for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature  and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet\n",
      " and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient  being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers  backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents  without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful  who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them\n",
      "therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things\n",
      "but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things\n",
      "and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god\n",
      "or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance\n",
      "but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile  but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile  for there is no respect of persons with god\n",
      "for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law  for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified\n",
      " for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves  which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another   in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel\n",
      " behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god  and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law  and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness  an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law\n",

      " and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law\n",
      " for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh  but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god\n",
      "what advantage then hath the jew\n",
      "or what profit is there of circumcision\n",
      "much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god\n",
      "for what if some did not believe\n",
      "shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect\n",
      "god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged\n",
      "but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say\n",
      "is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance\n",
      "i speak as a man god forbid for then how shall god judge the world\n",
      "for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am i also judged as a sinner\n",
      "and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say  let us do evil that good may come\n",
      "whose damnation is just\n",
      "what then\n",
      "are we better than they\n",
      "no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin  as it is written there is none righteous no not one  there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god\n",
      "they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one\n",
      " their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips  whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness  their feet are swift to shed blood  destruction and misery are in their ways  and the way of peace have they not known  there is no fear of god before their eyes\n",
      " now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god\n",
      " therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin\n",
      " but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets  even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god  being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus  whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god  to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus\n",
      " where is boasting then\n",
      "it is excluded\n",
      "by what law\n",
      "of works\n",
      "nay but by the law of faith\n",
      " therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law\n",
      " is he the god of the jews only\n",
      "is he not also of the gentiles\n",
      "yes of the gentiles also  seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith\n",
      " do we then make void the law through faith\n",
      "god forbid yea we establish the law\n",
      "what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found\n",
      "for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god\n",
      "for what saith the scripture\n",
      "abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness\n",
      "now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt\n",
      "but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness\n",
      "even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered\n",
      "blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin\n",
      "cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also\n",
      "for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness\n",
      " how was it then reckoned\n",
      "when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision\n",
      "not in circumcision but in uncircumcision\n",
      " and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised\n",
      " for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith\n",
      " for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect  because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression\n",
      " therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all  as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations  before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were\n",
      " who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be\n",
      " and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah s womb  he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god  and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform\n",
      " and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness\n",
      "now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him  but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead  who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification\n",
      "therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god\n",
      "and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us\n",
      "for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly\n",
      "for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die\n",
      "but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us\n",
      "much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him\n",
      " for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life\n",
      " and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement\n",
      "wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned  for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law\n",
      " nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam s transgression who is the figure of him that was to come\n",
      " but not as the offence so also is the free gift\n",
      "for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many\n",
      " and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification\n",
      " for if by one man s offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ \n",
      " therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life\n",
      " for as by one man s disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous\n",
      " moreover the law entered that the offence might abound\n",
      "but where sin abounded grace did much more abound  that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord\n",
      "what shall we say then\n",
      "shall we continue in sin that grace may abound\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      "how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein\n",
      "know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death\n",
      "therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life\n",
      "for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin\n",
      "for he that is dead is freed from sin\n",
      "now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him\n",
      " for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god\n",
      " likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord\n",
      "let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof\n",
      " neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god\n",
      " for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace\n",
      " what then\n",
      "shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      " know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness\n",
      " but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you\n",
      " being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness\n",
      " i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness\n",
      " for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness\n",
      " what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed\n",
      "for the end of those things is death\n",
      " but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life\n",
      "for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord\n",
      "know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law  how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth\n",
      "for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband\n",
      "so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man\n",
      "wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god\n",
      "for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death\n",
      "but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter\n",
      "what shall we say then\n",
      "is the law sin\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      "nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet\n",
      "but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence\n",
      "for without the law sin was dead\n",
      "for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died\n",
      " and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death\n",
      " for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me\n",
      "wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good\n",
      " was then that which is good made death unto me\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      "but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful\n",
      " for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin\n",
      " for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i\n",
      " if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good\n",
      " now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me\n",
      " for i know that in me that is in my flesh  dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not\n",
      " for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do\n",
      " now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me\n",
      " i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me\n",
      " for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members\n",
      " o wretched man that i am\n",
      "who shall deliver me from the body of this death\n",
      " i thank god through jesus christ our lord\n",
      "so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin\n",
      "there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit\n",
      "for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death\n",
      "for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit\n",
      "for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit\n",
      "for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace\n",
      "because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be\n",
      "so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god\n",
      "but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you\n",
      "now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his\n",
      " and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness\n",
      " but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you\n",
      "therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh\n",
      " for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live\n",
      " for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god\n",
      " for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father\n",
      " the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god  and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together\n",
      " for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us\n",
      " for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god\n",
      " for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope  because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god\n",
      " for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now\n",
      "and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body\n",
      " for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for\n",
      " but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it\n",
      " likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered\n",
      " and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god\n",
      " and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose\n",
      " for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren\n",
      " moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified\n",
      " what shall we then say to these things\n",

      "  for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation\n",

      " and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them   let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway\n",
      "  i say then have they stumbled that they should fall\n",
      "god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy\n",
      " now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness\n",
      "  for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office   if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them\n",
      "  for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead\n",
      "  for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches\n",
      "  and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree   boast not against the branches\n",
      "but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee\n",
      "  thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in\n",
      "  well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith\n",
      "be not highminded but fear   for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee\n",
      "  behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off\n",
      " and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again\n",
      "  for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree\n",
      "  for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in\n",
      "  and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob   for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins\n",
      "  as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father s sakes\n",
      "  for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance\n",
      "  for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief   even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy\n",

      "for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith\n",

      "was paul crucified for you\n",
      "or were ye baptized in the name of paul\n",
      " i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius  lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name\n",
      " and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other\n",
      " for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect\n",
      " for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god\n",
      " for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent\n",
      " where is the wise\n",
      "where is the scribe\n",
      "where is the disputer of this world\n",
      "hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world\n",
      " for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe\n",
      " for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness  but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god\n",
      " because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men\n",
      " for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called  but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty  and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are  that no flesh should glory in his presence\n",
      " but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption  that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord\n",
      "and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god\n",
      "for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified\n",
      "and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling\n",
      "and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man s wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god\n",
      "howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory\n",
      "but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him\n",
      " but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god\n",
      " for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him\n",
      "even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god\n",
      "now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god\n",
      " which things also we speak not in the words which man s wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual\n",
      " but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned\n",
      " but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man\n",
      " for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him\n",
      "but we have the mind of christ\n",
      "and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ\n",
      "i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able\n",
      "for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men\n",
      "for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal\n",
      "who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man\n",
      "i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase\n",
      "so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase\n",
      "now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour\n",
      "for we are labourers together with god ye are god s husbandry ye are god s building\n",
      " according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon\n",
      "but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon\n",
      " for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ\n",
      "now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble  every man s work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man s work of what sort it is\n",
      " if any man s work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward\n",
      " if any man s work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire\n",
      " know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you\n",
      " if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are\n",
      " let no man deceive himself\n",
      "if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise\n",
      " for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god\n",
      "for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness\n",
      " and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain\n",
      " therefore let no man glory in men\n",
      "for all things are your s  whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are your s and ye are christ s and christ is god s\n",
      "let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god\n",
      "moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful\n",
      "but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man s judgment yea i judge not mine own self\n",
      "for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord\n",
      "therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god\n",
      "and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another\n",
      "for who maketh thee to differ from another\n",
      "and what hast thou that thou didst not receive\n",
      "now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it\n",
      "now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you\n",
      "for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men\n",
      " we are fools for christ s sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised\n",
      " even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it  being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day\n",
      " i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you\n",
      " for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel\n",
      " wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me\n",
      " for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church\n",
      " now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you\n",
      " but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power\n",
      " for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power\n",
      " what will ye\n",
      "shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness\n",
      "it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father s wife\n",
      "and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you\n",
      "for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus\n",
      "your glorying is not good\n",
      "know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump\n",
      "purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened\n",
      "for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth\n",
      "i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators  yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world\n",
      " but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat\n",
      "for what have i to do to judge them also that are without\n",
      "do not ye judge them that are within\n",
      " but them that are without god judgeth\n",
      "therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person\n",
      "dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints\n",

      "and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters\n",
      "know ye not that we shall judge angels\n",
      "how much more things that pertain to this life\n",
      "if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church\n",
      "i speak to your shame\n",
      "is it so that there is not a wise man among you\n",
      "no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren\n",
      "but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers\n",
      "now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another\n",

      "why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded\n",
      "nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren\n",

      "be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind  nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god\n",
      " and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god\n",
      "all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any\n",
      " meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them\n",
      "now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body\n",
      " and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power\n",
      " know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ\n",
      "shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      " what\n",

      " flee fornication\n",
      "every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body\n",
      " what\n",
      "know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own\n",
      " for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god s\n",
      "now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman\n",
      "nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband\n",
      "let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband\n",
      "the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife\n",
      "defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency\n",
      "but i speak this by permission and not of commandment\n",
      "for i would that all men were even as i myself\n",
      "but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that\n",
      "i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i\n",
      "but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn\n",
      " and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband  but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife\n",
      "but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away\n",
      " and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him\n",
      " for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy\n",
      " but if the unbelieving depart let him depart\n",
      "a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace\n",
      " for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband\n",
      "or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife\n",
      " but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk\n",
      "and so ordain i in all churches\n",
      " is any man called being circumcised\n",
      "let him not become uncircumcised\n",
      "is any called in uncircumcision\n",
      "let him not be circumcised\n",
      " circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god\n",
      " let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called\n",
      " art thou called being a servant\n",
      "care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather\n",
      " for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord s freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christ s servant\n",
      "ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men\n",
      " brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god\n",
      " now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful\n",
      " i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be\n",
      " art thou bound unto a wife\n",
      "seek not to be loosed\n",
      "art thou loosed from a wife\n",
      "seek not a wife\n",
      " but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned\n",
      "nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you\n",
      " but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none  and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not  and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away\n",
      " but i would have you without carefulness\n",
      "he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord  but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife\n",
      "there is difference also between a wife and a virgin\n",
      "the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband\n",
      " and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction\n",
      " but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry\n",
      " nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well\n",
      " so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better\n",
      " the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord\n",
      " but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god\n",
      "now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge\n",
      "knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth\n",
      "and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know\n",
      "but if any man love god the same is known of him\n",
      "as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one\n",
      "for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many  but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him\n",
      "howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled\n",
      "but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse\n",
      "but take heed lest by any means this liberty of your s become a stumblingblock to them that are weak\n",
      " for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol s temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols  and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died\n",
      "but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ\n",
      " wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend\n",
      "am i not an apostle\n",
      "am i not free\n",

      "are not ye my work in the lord\n",
      "if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord\n",
      "mine answer to them that do examine me is this have we not power to eat and to drink\n",
      "have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas\n",

      "say i these things as a man\n",
      "or saith not the law the same also\n",

      " do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple\n",
      "and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar\n",
      " even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel\n",
      " but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void\n",
      " for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel\n",
      " for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me\n",
      " what is my reward then\n",
      "verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel\n",
      " for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more\n",
      " and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law  to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ  that i might gain them that are without law\n",

      " moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea  and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea  and did all eat the same spiritual meat  and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ\n",
      " but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness\n",

      "  what say i then\n",
      "that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing\n",
      "  but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils\n",
      "  ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lord s table and of the table of devils\n",

      " if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing\n",
      "if the whole were hearing where were the smelling\n",

      " and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it\n",

      "are all prophets\n",
      "are all teachers\n",

      "  for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified\n",
      "  i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all   yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue\n",
      "  brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men\n",
      "  in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord\n",
      "  wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe\n",

      "  but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all   and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth\n",
      "  how is it then brethren\n",
      "when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation\n",
      "let all things be done unto edifying\n",
      "  if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret\n",
      "  but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god\n",
      "  let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge\n",

      " moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand  by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain\n",
      " for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures  and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures  and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve  after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep\n",
      " after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles\n",
      " and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time\n",
      " for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god\n",
      "  but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me\n",
      "  therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed\n",
      " now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead\n",
      "  but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen   and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain\n",
      "  yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not\n",
      "  for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised   and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins\n",
      "  then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished\n",
      "  if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable\n",
      "  but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept\n",
      "  for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead\n",
      "  for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive\n",
      " but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christ s at his coming\n",
      "  then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power\n",
      "  for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet\n",
      "  the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\n",
      "  for he hath put all things under his feet\n",
      "but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him\n",
      "  and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all\n",
      "  else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all\n",
      "why are they then baptized for the dead\n",
      "  and why stand we in jeopardy every hour\n",
      "  i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily\n",
      "  if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not\n",
      "let us eat and drink for to morrow we die\n",
      "  be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners\n",
      " awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame\n",
      "  but some man will say how are the dead raised up\n",
      "and with what body do they come\n",
      "  thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die   and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain   but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body\n",
      "  all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds\n",
      "  there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another\n",
      "  there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory\n",
      "  so also is the resurrection of the dead\n",
      "it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption   it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power   it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body\n",
      "there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body\n",
      " and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit\n",
      "  howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual\n",
      "  the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven\n",
      "  as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly\n",
      "  and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly\n",
      "  now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption\n",
      "  behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed   in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed\n",
      "  for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality\n",
      "  so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory\n",
      "  o death where is thy sting\n",
      "o grave where is thy victory\n",
      " the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law\n",
      "  but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ\n",
      "  therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord\n",
      " now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye\n",
      " upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come\n",

      " for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit\n",
      " but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost\n",
      " for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries\n",
      "  now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do\n",
      "  let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren\n",

      " for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish  to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life\n",
      "and who is sufficient for these things\n",
      " for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ\n",
      "do we begin again to commend ourselves\n",
      "or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you\n",
      "ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart\n",
      "and such trust have we through christ to god ward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life\n",
      "but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious\n",
      "for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory\n",
      " for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth\n",
      " for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious\n",
      "seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech  and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished  but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ\n",
      " but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart\n",
      " nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away\n",
      " now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty\n",
      " but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord\n",
      "therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man s conscience in the sight of god\n",
      "but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them\n",
      "for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake\n",
      "for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ\n",
      "but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us\n",
      "we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed  always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body\n",
      " for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh\n",
      "so then death worketh in us but life in you\n",
      " we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak  knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you\n",
      " for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god\n",
      " for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day\n",
      " for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory  while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal\n",
      "for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens\n",
      "for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked\n",
      "for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life\n",
      "now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit\n",
      "therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight  we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord\n",
      "wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him\n",
      " for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad\n",
      " knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences\n",
      "for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart\n",
      " for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause\n",
      " for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead  and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again\n",
      " wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more\n",
      " therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new\n",
      " and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation  to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation\n",
      " now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ s stead be ye reconciled to god\n",
      " for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him\n",
      "we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain\n",
      "for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation \n",
      "giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed  as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things\n",
      " o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged\n",
      "ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels\n",
      " now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children  be ye also enlarged\n",
      " be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness\n",
      "and what communion hath light with darkness\n",
      " and what concord hath christ with belial\n",
      "or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel\n",
      " and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols\n",
      "for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people\n",
      " wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you\n",
      " and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty\n",
      "having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god\n",
      "receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man\n",
      "i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you\n",
      "great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation\n",
      "for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears\n",
      "nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more\n",
      "for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season\n",
      "now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing\n",
      " for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death\n",
      " for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge\n",
      "in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter\n",
      "wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you\n",
      " therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all\n",
      " for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth\n",
      " and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him\n",
      " i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things\n",
      "moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality\n",
      "for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints\n",
      "and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god\n",
      "insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also\n",
      "therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also\n",
      "i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love\n",
      "for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich\n",
      " and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago\n",
      " now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have\n",
      "for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not\n",
      " for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened  but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality  as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack\n",
      " but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you\n",
      " for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you\n",
      " and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches  and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind  avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men\n",
      " and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you\n",
      "whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ\n",
      " wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf\n",
      "for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many\n",
      "yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting\n",
      "therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness\n",
      "but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully\n",
      "every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver\n",
      "and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever\n",
      " now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness   being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god\n",
      "for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god  whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men  and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you\n",
      " thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift\n",
      " now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you  but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh\n",
      " for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh  for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds   casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ  and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled\n",
      " do ye look on things after the outward appearance\n",
      "if any man trust to himself that he is christ s let him of himself think this again that as he is christ s even so are we christ s\n",
      " for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed  that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters\n",
      "  for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible\n",
      "  let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present\n",
      " for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise\n",
      "  but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you\n",
      "  for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ   not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men s labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly   to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another man s line of things made ready to our hand\n",
      "  but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord\n",
      "  for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth\n",
      " would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me\n",
      " for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ\n",
      " but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ\n",
      " for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him\n",
      " for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles\n",
      " but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things\n",
      " have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely\n",
      " i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service\n",
      " and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself\n",
      "  as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia\n",
      "  wherefore\n",
      "because i love you not\n",
      "god knoweth\n",
      " but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we\n",
      "  for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ\n",
      "  and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light\n",
      "  therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works\n",
      "  i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little\n",
      "  that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting\n",
      "  seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also\n",
      "  for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise\n",
      "  for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face\n",
      "  i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak\n",
      "howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly  i am bold also\n",
      "  are they hebrews\n",
      "so am i\n",
      "are they israelites\n",
      "so am i\n",
      "are they the seed of abraham\n",
      "so am i\n",
      " are they ministers of christ\n",
      "i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft\n",
      "  of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one\n",
      "  thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep   in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren   in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness\n",
      "  beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches\n",
      "  who is weak and i am not weak\n",
      "who is offended and i burn not\n",
      "  if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities\n",
      "  the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not\n",
      "  in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me   and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands\n",
      "it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory\n",
      "i will come to visions and revelations of the lord\n",
      "i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth  such an one caught up to the third heaven\n",
      "and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth  how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter\n",
      "of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities\n",
      "for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me\n",
      "and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure\n",
      "for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me\n",
      "and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness\n",
      "most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me\n",
      " therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ s sake for when i am weak then am i strong\n",
      " i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing\n",
      "truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds\n",
      " for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you\n",
      "forgive me this wrong\n",
      " behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not your s but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children\n",
      " and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved\n",
      " but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile\n",
      " did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you\n",
      " i desired titus and with him i sent a brother\n",
      "did titus make a gain of you\n",
      "walked we not in the same spirit\n",
      "walked we not in the same steps\n",
      " again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you\n",
      "we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying\n",
      " for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults  and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed\n",
      " this is the third time i am coming to you\n",
      "in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established\n",
      " i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare  since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to you ward is not weak but is mighty in you\n",
      " for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god\n",
      "for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you\n",
      " examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves\n",
      "know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates\n",
      " but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates\n",
      " now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates\n",
      " for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth\n",
      " for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection\n",
      "  therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction\n",
      "  finally brethren farewell\n",
      "be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you\n",

      "the epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians\n",
      "paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead  and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever\n",
      "amen\n",
      "i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ\n",
      "but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed\n",
      "as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed\n",

      "or do i seek to please men\n",
      "for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ\n",
      " but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man\n",
      "for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ\n",
      " for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it  and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers\n",
      " but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother s womb and called me by his grace  to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood  neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus\n",
      " then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days\n",
      " but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord s brother\n",
      " now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not\n",
      " afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia  and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed\n",
      " and they glorified god in me\n",
      "then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also\n",
      "and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain\n",
      "but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you\n",
      "but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man s person  for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles  and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision\n",
      " only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do\n",
      " but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed\n",
      "for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision\n",
      " and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation\n",
      " but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews\n",
      " we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles  knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified\n",
      " but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin\n",
      "god forbid\n",
      " for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor\n",
      " for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god\n",
      " i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me\n",
      " i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain\n",
      "o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you\n",
      "this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith\n",
      "are ye so foolish\n",
      "having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh\n",
      "have ye suffered so many things in vain\n",
      "if it be yet in vain\n",
      "he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith\n",
      "even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness\n",
      "know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham\n",
      "and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed\n",
      "so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham\n",
      " for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them\n",
      " but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith\n",
      "and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them\n",
      " christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree  that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith\n",
      " brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man s covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto\n",
      " now to abraham and his seed were the promises made\n",
      "he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ\n",
      " and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect\n",
      " for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise\n",
      " wherefore then serveth the law\n",
      "it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator\n",
      " now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one\n",
      " is the law then against the promises of god\n",
      "god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law\n",
      " but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe\n",
      "but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed\n",
      " wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith\n",
      " but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster\n",
      " for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus\n",
      " for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ\n",
      " there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus\n",
      " and if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise\n",
      "now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father\n",
      "even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons\n",
      "and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father\n",
      "wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ\n",
      "howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods\n",
      "but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage\n",
      " ye observe days and months and times and years\n",
      " i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain\n",
      "brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all\n",
      " ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first\n",
      " and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus\n",
      " where is then the blessedness ye spake of\n",
      "for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me\n",
      " am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth\n",
      " they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them\n",
      " but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when i am present with you\n",
      " my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you  i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you\n",
      " tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law\n",
      " for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman\n",
      "but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise\n",
      " which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar\n",
      " for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children\n",
      " but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all\n",
      " for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband\n",
      " now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise\n",
      " but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now\n",
      " nevertheless what saith the scripture\n",
      "cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman\n",
      " so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free\n",
      "stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage\n",
      "behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing\n",
      "for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law\n",
      "christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace\n",
      "for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith\n",
      "for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love\n",
      "ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth\n",
      "this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you\n",
      "a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump\n",
      " i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be\n",

      "then is the offence of the cross ceased\n",
      "i would they were even cut off which trouble you\n",
      " for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another\n",

      " but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another\n",
      " this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh\n",
      " for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would\n",
      " but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law\n",
      " now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness  idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies  envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god\n",
      " but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law\n",
      " and they that are christ s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts\n",
      " if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit\n",

      "bear ye one another s burdens and so fulfil the law of christ\n",
      "for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself\n",
      "but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another\n",

      "as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ\n",

      "for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee\n",
      "and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son\n",
      "and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him\n",
      "and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire\n",
      "but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom\n",
      "thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows\n",
      " and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands  they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail\n",
      " but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool\n",
      " are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation\n",
      "therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip\n",
      "for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will\n",
      "for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak\n",
      "but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him\n",
      "or the son of man that thou visitest him\n",
      "thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet\n",

      " for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham\n",
      " wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people\n",

      "wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years\n",
      " wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways\n",

      " but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin\n",
      " for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end  while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation\n",
      " for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses\n",
      " but with whom was he grieved forty years\n",
      "was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness\n",
      " and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not\n",
      " so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief\n",
      "let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it\n",
      "for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it\n",
      "for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world\n",
      "for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works\n",
      "and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest\n",
      "seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts\n",
      "for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day\n",
      "there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god\n",
      " for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his\n",
      " let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief\n",
      "for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart\n",
      " neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do\n",
      " seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession\n",
      " for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin\n",
      " let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need\n",
      "for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity\n",
      "and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins\n",
      "and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron\n",
      "so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee\n",
      "as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec\n",
      "who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him  called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec\n",
      " of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing\n",
      "for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat\n",
      " for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe\n",
      " but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil\n",
      "therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment\n",
      "and this will we do if god permit\n",
      "for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame\n",
      "for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned\n",
      "but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak\n",
      " for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister\n",
      " and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises\n",
      " for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself  saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee\n",
      " and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise\n",
      " for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife\n",
      " wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath  that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us  which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil  whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec\n",
      "for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually\n",
      "now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils\n",
      "and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises\n",
      "and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better\n",
      "and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth\n",
      "and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham\n",
      " for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him\n",
      " if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law  what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron\n",
      "for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law\n",
      " for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar\n",
      " for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood\n",
      " and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest  who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life\n",
      " for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec\n",
      " for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof\n",
      " for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god\n",
      " and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest  for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec   by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament\n",
      "and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death  but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood\n",
      " wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them\n",
      " for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens  who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people s for this he did once when he offered up himself\n",
      " for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore\n",
      "now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man\n",
      "for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer\n",
      "for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount\n",
      "but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises\n",
      "for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second\n",
      "for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord\n",
      " for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people  and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest\n",
      "for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more\n",
      " in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old\n",
      "now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away\n",
      "then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary\n",
      "for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary\n",
      "and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron s rod that budded and the tables of the covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly\n",
      "now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god\n",
      "but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience  which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation\n",
      " but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us\n",
      " for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh  how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god\n",
      " and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance\n",
      " for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator\n",
      " for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth\n",
      " whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood\n",
      " for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people  saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you\n",
      " moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry\n",
      " and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission\n",
      "it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these\n",
      " for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us  nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others  for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself\n",
      " and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment  so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation\n",
      " for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect\n",
      " for then would they not have ceased to be offered\n",
      "because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins\n",
      " but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year\n",
      " for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins\n",
      " wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me  in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure\n",
      " then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me  to do thy will o god\n",
      " above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law  then said he lo i come to do thy will o god\n",
      "he taketh away the first that he may establish the second\n",
      "  by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all\n",
      "  and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins  but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god   from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool\n",
      "  for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified\n",
      "  whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before   this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them   and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more\n",

      " and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man s work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear  forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers  but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot  who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you  who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god\n",

      "unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed\n",
      "but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light  which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy\n",
      " dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation\n",
      " submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord s sake whether it be to the king as supreme  or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well\n",

      "but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god\n",
      " for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps  who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously  who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed\n",
      " for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls\n",
      "likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear\n",

      "for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement\n",
      "likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered\n",

      " for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing\n",
      " for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit  by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison  which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water\n",
      " the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god  by the resurrection of jesus christ  who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him\n",
      "forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god\n",
      "for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead\n",
      "for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit\n",
      "but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer\n",
      "and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins\n",
      "use hospitality one to another without grudging\n",
      " as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god\n",
      " if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever\n",

      "beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you  but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ s sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy\n",
      " if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified\n",
      " but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men s matters\n",
      " yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf\n",
      " for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god\n",

      "the second general epistle of peter\n",
      "simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust\n",
      "and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity\n",
      "for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ\n",
      "but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins\n",
      " wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall  for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ\n",
      "wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth\n",
      " yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance  knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me\n",
      " moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance\n",
      " for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty\n",
      " for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased\n",
      " and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount\n",
      " we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts  knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation\n",
      " for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost\n",
      "but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction\n",
      "and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of\n",
      "and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not\n",
      "for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds  the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished  but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government\n",
      "presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities\n",
      " whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord\n",
      "but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption  and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time\n",
      "spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you  having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children  which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness  but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man s voice forbad the madness of the prophet\n",
      " these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever\n",
      " for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error\n",
      " while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage\n",
      " for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning\n",
      " for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them\n",
      " but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire\n",
      "this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming\n",
      "for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation\n",
      "for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men\n",
      "but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day\n",
      "the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance\n",
      " but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up\n",
      " seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat\n",
      " nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness\n",
      " wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless\n",
      " and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you  as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction\n",
      " ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness\n",

      "amen\n",
      " and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes\n",
      "and whence came they\n",
      " and i said unto him sir thou knowest\n",
      "and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb\n",
      " therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them\n",
      " they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat\n",
      " for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes\n",
      "and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour\n",
      "and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets\n",
      "and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne\n",
      "and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel s hand\n",
      "and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake\n",
      "and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound\n",
      "the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up\n",
      "and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed\n",
      " and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters  and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter\n",
      "and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise\n",
      " and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound\n",
      "and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit\n",
      "and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit\n",
      "and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power\n",
      "and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads\n",
      "and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man\n",
      "and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them\n",
      "and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men\n",
      "and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions\n",
      "and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle\n",
      " and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months\n",
      " and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon\n",
      "one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter\n",
      " and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god  saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates\n",
      " and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men\n",
      " and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them\n",
      " and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone\n",
      " by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths\n",
      " for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt\n",
      " and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk  neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts\n",
      " and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire  and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth  and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices\n",
      " and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not\n",
      " and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven  and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer  but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets\n",
      " and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth\n",
      " and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book\n",
      "and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey\n",
      "  and i took the little book out of the angel s hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter\n",
      "  and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings\n",
      " and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein\n",
      " but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months\n",
      " and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth\n",
      " these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth\n",
      " and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed\n",
      " these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will\n",
      " and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them\n",
      " and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified\n",
      " and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves\n",
      "  and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth\n",
      "  and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them\n",
      " and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither\n",
      "and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them\n",
      "  and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven\n",
      "  the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly\n",
      "  and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever\n",
      "  and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god   saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned\n",
      "  and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth\n",
      "  and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail\n",
      "and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered\n",
      "and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads\n",
      "and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born\n",
      "and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne\n",
      "and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days\n",
      "and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven\n",
      "and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him\n",
      " and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night\n",

      "for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time\n",
      " and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child\n",
      " and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent\n",
      " and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood\n",
      " and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth\n",
      " and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ\n",
      " and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy\n",
      " and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority\n",
      " and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast\n",
      " and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast\n",
      "who is able to make war with him\n",
      " and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months\n",
      " and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven\n",

      "  rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her\n",
      "  and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all\n",
      "  and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee  and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived\n",
      "  and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth\n",
      " and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god  for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand\n",
      " and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever\n",
      " and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia\n",
      " and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great\n",
      " and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth\n",
      " let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready\n",
      " and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints\n",
      " and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb\n",
      "and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god\n",
      "  and i fell at his feet to worship him\n",
      "and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy\n",
      "  and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war\n",
      " his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself\n",
      "  and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god\n",

      "  and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords\n",
      "  and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god   that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great\n",
      "  and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army\n",
      "  and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image\n",
      "these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone\n",
      "  and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh\n",
      " and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand\n",
      " and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years  and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season\n",
      " and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years\n",
      " but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished\n",
      "this is the first resurrection\n",
      " blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years\n",
      " and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison  and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea\n",
      " and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them\n",
      "  and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever\n",
      "  and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them\n",
      " and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works\n",
      "  and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works\n",
      "  and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire\n",
      "this is the second death\n",
      "  and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire\n",
      " and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea\n",
      " and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband\n",
      " and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god\n",
      " and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away\n",
      " and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new\n",
      "and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful\n",
      " and he said unto me it is done\n",
      "i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end\n",
      "i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely\n",
      " he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son\n",
      " but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death\n",
      " and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lamb s wife\n",
      "  and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god   having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal  and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel   on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates\n",
      "  and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb\n",
      "  and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof\n",
      "  and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs\n",
      "the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal\n",
      "  and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel\n",
      "  and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass\n",
      "  and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones\n",
      "the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald   the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst\n",
      "  and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass\n",
      "  and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it\n",
      " and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof\n",
      "  and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it\n",
      "  and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there\n",
      "  and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it\n",
      "  and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb s book of life\n",
      " and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb\n",
      " in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations\n",
      " and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him  and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads\n",
      " and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever\n",
      " and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done\n",
      " behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book\n",
      " and i john saw these things and heard them\n",
      "and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things\n",
      " then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god\n",
      "  and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand\n",
      "  he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still\n",
      " and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be\n",
      "  i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last\n",
      "  blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city\n",
      "  for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie\n",
      "  i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches\n",
      "i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star\n",
